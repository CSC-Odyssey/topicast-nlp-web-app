They see the smallest and simplest things which make the most sense,” said Tian, “they would show us how to create an equitable city, because if you create a city for kids, you create a city for all.”</p><p>Architect Tabangin mentioned that the Streets for Children roadshop is part of the Safe and Sound Cities program aiming to teach leadership to the youth so they can also become co-decision makers in anything that affects their spaces.</p><p>Furthermore, Architect Tabangin said that the Streets for Children Roadshop is only one of the many things they plan to do in the city. - By Patrick Balanon</p>',\n",

       "  '<p>The city of Baguio is filled with various natural attractions with its vast wide plains, high mountains, and cool temperature as it remains to be one of the best destinations to visit in the Philippines all year round. From the ground to the roots to the branches and leaves, we breathe the oxygen being released by the trees, with a mixture of flora and fauna which is not the only factor that entices visitors to keep coming in the city, but also because of the culture, arts, and sustainable practices. It gives the visitors a sense of respect for how the locals stay true to their values and city ordinances that are being implemented in the city. The city of Baguio has always been a safe haven for natural attractions and beautiful sceneries that have been standing even before it was sighted by the Spaniards when they first arrived in the highlands. The same goes with the Americans who sought the city as a rest and rehabilitation area, where they could relax, enjoy their leisure time, and escape the heat of the lowlands. After World War II, even after the city was occupied by the Japanese, some attractions remained standing up to this day which goes to show the significance of sustainable tourism in the city. We are to protect these reminders, in hopes to prolong the significance of our history but most importantly, our environment.</p><p>With sustainability being practiced in various countries, the City of Baguio also started to implement sustainable practices, as citizens, and being able to adapt and execute such practices is a huge step in our contribution to the preservation of our environment. Sustainability can be achieved through the small things we do in everyday life. With the combined help of both locals and tourists, the city is able to unite in helping each other create a green livelihood for all. Small things such as the usage of eco or paper bags over plastic ones, turning off power outlets or electrical appliances when not in use, or even saving water are among the common practices in living in a sustainable environment which are inlined with the Sustainable Development Goals #12, #6, and #14 or the Responsible Consumption and Production, Clean Water and Sanitation, and Life Below Water respectively. SDG 12 aims to promote the responsible and efficient use of our natural resources as well as reduce waste generation especially plastic through reduction, reuse and recycling. In connection with this, SDG 6 and 14 aims to improve water quality and protect marine life by not dumping hazardous chemicals into waterways and reducing pollution, most importantly plastic that mostly ends up in the ocean causing damage to the marine ecosystem.</p><p>Sustainable Tourism helps maintain and prolong the beauty of a certain area, thus allowing the future generations to enjoy the beauty of our surroundings. With Baguio being one of the fastest developing cities in the Philippines, one could wonder how the city maintains its greenery and natural beauty, and well, this is possible through acting on simple sustainable practices, a reminder that a little goes a long way and with camaraderie, anything is achievable. </p><p>Contributors: Edith Jane Chloe T.
