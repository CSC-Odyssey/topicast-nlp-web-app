1,"CEO: 1,200 properties encroached on RROW","April 30, 2023","Around 1,200 property owners in the city have been found encroaching road rights-of-way (RROW).
The finding was reported based on the ongoing RROW recovery program of the city government that has so far mapped an estimated 40 percent of the Baguio’s 128 barangays.
In a media forum on April 26, Engr. Januario Borillo, chief of the City Engineering Office’s Traffic and Transportation Management Division, said more or less 37,000 square meters of RROW have been encroached at present.
He said his office, in coordination with the City Treasury Office (CTO), plans to do a mapping project that would specify individual owners whose structures have occupied RROWs.
The number of square meters of RROW these structures have occupied will then be determined and the appropriate rent may be charged the erring lot owners, Borillo said.
“These rentals could be a source of additional revenue for the city government that will be allocated to support its ongoing RROW recovery program, which has a limited budget,” he said.
Borillo added a problem possibly faced by some of those applying for building permits is that they may not know that their structures have already encroached on RROW.
“In this matter, our office can help them by mapping the barangays where these owners can see whether their structures have gone out of their property lines or not. This is where the RROW recovery program can help them,” he said. 
The RROW recovery program primarily aims to help ease the city’s traffic situation along major thoroughfares and ensure these are compliant to the standard width. – Gaby B. Keith

3,Police to taxi drivers: Dashcams important,"April 30, 2023","Following the robbery of a taxi driver in Baguio City by two male suspects, the Baguio City Police Office reminds drivers to have dash cameras installed in their vehicles.
BCPO Abanao Police Station commander Maj. Lee Alvin Alinao, in an interview with PTV-Cordillera, said taxi drivers and operators should make sure that their dashcams are working properly.
The incident, which happened at 3 a.m. of April 26 in front of the University of the Cordilleras gate 5, was caught in the dashcam of the taxi.  
The suspects, wearing face masks and baseball caps, boarded along Marcos Highway and told the driver to bring them to the night market at Harrison Road. 
But upon reaching the ill-lighted area along Harrison Road, the suspects announced a holdup where one of the suspects placed a knife around the victim’s neck.
It could be seen and heard from the footage of the dashcam the driver was pleading for the suspects to get his earnings for the day, but spare his life as he has a family to come home to. 
In the police report, it stated the victim grabbed the suspect’s hand holding the knife to remove it from his neck. Taking his chance, he dashed out of the taxi and ran towards Burnham Park where he reported to the tourist police unit in the area.
Police personnel immediately conducted a search for the area which led to the arrest of the suspects who were found at Burnham Park.
The 17-year-old suspect was committed to the City Social Welfare and Development Office Bahay Pag-asa for being a minor, while the 19-year-old suspect was brought to the Baguio City Jail. They are facing a case of attempted robbery with violence.
The 33-year-old victim sustained lacerations in his neck and right wrist and was discharged from the hospital in stable condition.
Alinao said the incident is the first robbing incident for a taxi driver to be reported this year. He advised taxi drivers to take extra precaution when on duty especially on the wee hours of the morning. – Ofelia C. Empian

4,P5 M allocation for Kennon tourist area dev’t approved,"April 30, 2023","The city council has approved the allocation of P5 million as the city government’s counterpart to the development of a tourist rest area along Kennon Road.
The approval came with the condition that the agreement between the Department of Environment and Natural Resources and Mayor Benjamin Magalong that involves the city’s payment of lease to the DENR will be submitted for ratification.
The city council earlier sought a clarification on the agreement in which the city government is being asked to lease from the DENR the area identified as tourist rest site along Kennon Road.
The allocation of P5M for the site development at Kennon was identified as a priority project and is part of the supplemental budget earlier submitted for council approval, but was then deferred pending an explanation on the lease contract.
City Planning, Development, and Sustainability Office head Donna Tabangin told the council the original plan was for the DENR and the city government sign a memorandum of agreement to share the profits that will be derived from the area where a structure that will accommodate a souvenir shop, cafe, and toilets, including parking, will be constructed using the P9M grant from the Tourism Infrastructure and Enterprise Zone Authority (Tieza).
Tabangin said when the MOA was forwarded to the DENR central office, the former asked the city to instead lease the property for P220,000 annually. The DENR owns the 1,500-square meter area.
She said the city will engage a third party to operate the tourism rest area and pay a monthly rent of P800 per square meter.
Asked by Councilor Benny Bomogao how much the city government is projected to earn from subleasing the property, Tabangin said on the first year, the income from a lease of P800 per square meter would be P1,267,000.
“If the city spends for the maintenance of the building, the net profit on the first year would be P446,700,” she said.
Councilor Jose Molintas asked if the city government could instead request from the DENR the free use of the property, but City Administrator Bonifacio dela Peña said the mayor already negotiated with the DENR to lower the lease to P220,000 yearly.
“The DENR asked for a lease of P2.2M yearly, but the mayor negotiated and was able to lower it to P220,000 annually or P22,000 monthly,” he said.
Department of Tourism-Cordillera Legal Officer Brenden Quintos said the agency is waiting for the finalization of the agreement between Baguio and DENR before it can proceed with the issuance of documents for the P9M grant to be released by Tieza. – Jane B. Cadalig

5,"With sporadic rains, city sounds off dengue alert","April 30, 2023","Mayor Benjamin Magalong advised residents to be on guard against dengue fever this early as the city experiences intermittent rains especially in the afternoons.
The mayor said dengue has been a serious health concern as every year, cases rise during rainy seasons experienced from June to October.
“But as we are now experiencing sporadic rains, we need to observe preventive measures like ridding our surroundings of mosquito breeding places to make sure that dengue-carrying mosquitoes will not thrive,” the mayor said.
The City Health Services Office has always advised residents on practicing the 4S strategy: search and destroy mosquito breeding places; self-protection measures (use window screens, mosquito nets, wear protective clothing, use insect repellents); seek early consultation; and say no to indiscriminate fogging.
“Walang dengue kung walang lamok. Walang lamok kung walang breeding places. Walang breeding places kung malinis ang kapaligiran. Ugaliing mag-search and destroy at gawin nang sabay-sabay upang siguradong mawalan ng breeding places ang mga dengue-carrying mosquitoes,” advised Dr. Donnabel Panes, head of the City Epidemiology Surveillance Unit of the CHSO.
Engr. Charles Carame of the CHSO Sanitation Division said the CHSO’s dengue strategy follows the Prevent-Detect-Isolate-Treatment-Reintegration (PDITR) model: 
Prevent through the 4S strategy;
Detect through rapid testing and conduct of larval surveillance where samples of kiti-kiti are studied to predict an impending outbreak;
Isolate through a campaign for dengue-infected individuals to protect themselves from being bitten;
Treatment through an aggressive case reporting system and provision of dengue wards and fast lanes in hospitals; and
Reintegration through the sustained conduct of the strategies with the fact that dengue immunity does not cover all strains as a motivation. – Aileen P. Refuerzo

7,Rules set on busking at CBD,"April 30, 2023","The city government of Baguio will resume the conduct of Session Road Sunday Pedestrianization on May 7 after setting guidelines to address issues about buskers or street performers.
The city government suspended the Sunday promenades at Session Road after the Panagbenga Festival, giving back the main thoroughfare to motorists due to complaints against buskers and complaints from the buskers themselves.
Issues raised include the lack of guidelines on selling and/or merchants abusing their privilege; products sold are not different from market those sold in the market; crowding due to the unregulated operation of buskers; agents making busking a business; busking outside of Session Road and on weekdays; use of animals in busking; mendicants posing as buskers; harassment of buskers by promenaders and vice versa; and unregulated solicitations.
The City Tourism Office serving as the secretariat and overseer of the Session Road Sunday Pedestrianization activity proposed the following guidelines, which were immediately adopted by city executives during a management committee meeting held April 25.
Only buskers accredited by the City Tourism Office will be allowed at Session Road.
Requests for registration will be subject to curation and validation. Strictly, no ID, no busking.
Up to 150 buskers (number can vary as approved) are allowed on one given Sunday. Buskers shall be allowed only during their assigned schedules. All buskers scheduled on a given Sunday shall be assigned an area, moving out from assigned area/s is not allowed. Shared areas must be to some extent, equally divided.
Specially-abled buskers may be exempted from rotation on schedules and areas, as long as registered and endorsed by Persons with Disability Affairs Office. – PIO

9,Student leaders decry military’s intimidation,"April 30, 2023","The student council of the University of the Philippines Baguio called on city officials to denounce the alleged surveillance, harassment, and intimidation by military units on students and their families.
Student council officers Iya Trinidad, Angelika Joven, and Kendree Almero sought an audience with the Baguio City Council last April 17. 
Trinidad said five UPB students had been victims of surveillance, harassment, and intimidation by Task Group Baguio in a span of five months. She said these students had been visited by members of Task Group Baguio in their homes and had been accused as “potential recruits” of communist groups.
Almero called these acts “untimely, undemocratic, and unnecessary.” He appealed to the city council to call out and condemn such acts.
Councilor and Sangguniang Kabataan Federation President Levy Lloyd Orcales said during the public consultations regarding the proposed Youth Development Code of Baguio City, a number of students from different universities shared the same experience. 
Orcales said it was the fourth time that student leaders had reached out to the city council to express their recurrent concern with law enforcement agencies.
Councilor Mylen Yaranon said the city council will push for legislation protecting students and other individuals against red-tagging and police/military harassment. 
Incidentally, on the same day, the city council approved on first reading a proposed ordinance establishing a mechanism that protects the rights and fundamental freedom of human rights defenders in the city. 
On April 19, human rights defenders and members of various advocacy groups in the city trooped to the multipurpose hall of the Baguio City Hall to attend the public consultation facilitated by Councilor Jose Molintas. 
The consultation tackled the proposal of the Baguio City Police Office to give incentives to informants of members of communist groups. It also tackled red-tagging incidents in the city including the symposia or fora conducted by uniformed personnel in various schools in the city where various organizations were linked to communist groups and videos containing violent scenes were reportedly shown. 
Participants of the consultation, some of them claimed to have been red-tagged, denounced the vilification of student leaders and human rights defenders by state forces. 
They also opposed the proposed reward system for tipsters as this may result in a “witch hunt.”
They also condemned the conduct of forums in schools where legitimate organizations were branded as belonging to terrorist groups.
They called on the city council to enact legislation that would uphold academic freedom and would guarantee the protection of the youth from police and military intimidation.
Task Group Baguio Commander Cristopher Sab-it said the forums which they conducted in schools were part of their information-education campaign against insurgency in the country. He denied showing graphic videos and pictures during these forums.
Sab-it said he is open for dialogues with the advocacy groups and broached a joint information-education campaign with them. 
Lawyer Joecle Dongla of the CHR-Cordillera said 34 cases of red-tagging were filed before the CHR from 2018 to 2023. Of the number, 18 were dismissed, 13 were resolved with findings on human rights violations, and four are still pending. 
Earlier this year, an advocacy group called Justice and Peace Network in the Cordillera also called on the city council to craft guidelines on banning red-tagging and political vilification.
The group’s appeal was prompted by an incident at Session Road where a policeman allegedly harassed 14 of its members during a chalk art activity on Dec. 4, 2022. According to the group, the police officer allegedly linked their solidarity messages to terrorism.
Molintas said red-tagging is divisive and impinges on the right to free speech. – Jordan G. Habbiling

11,City gets aggressive in anti-squatting campaign,"April 30, 2023","The city government will halt ongoing constructions in residential and forest reservations that are not covered by building permits as it adopted a more aggressive stance against squatting and violators of the National Building Code and environment laws.
Mayor Benjamin Magalong who ordered an intensified campaign against ongoing illegal structures last March 3 formed a core group called the Baguio Anti-Squatting and Illegal Structures (Basis) to conduct inspections and identify and stop structural developments not covered by the necessary permits.
The Basis is composed of personnel from the City Buildings and Architecture Office, City Environment and Parks Management Office, City Legal Office, City Engineering Office and deputized environment officers of the Baguio City Police Office.
Since the mayor issued the order, BCPO City Director Col. Francis Bulwayan Jr. included the monitoring of ongoing constructions in residential, commercial and forest areas in regular patrol activities of the different police stations.
Those not covered by permits were reported to the CBAO for verification and issuance of notices of violation and cease and desist orders.
As a result of the inspections, an ongoing residential building construction at GEFA barangay was issued a cease and desist order with the owner advised against pursuing further construction activities and to secure building permit. The owner was likewise directed to clean and clear all construction materials and debris obstructing the sidewalk immediately and to enclose the construction site with green G.I sheets pursuant to Executive Order 17, s. 2020.
An ongoing construction of a rooftop enclosure at Roman Ayson, Campo Filipino was also slapped similar orders for having no permit.
In Outlook Drive, four ongoing structural developments (two ongoing building constructions, one extension and one digging of foundation) were found without building permits posted at the construction sites in Purok 2 and Purok 4.
The BCPO endorsed its findings to the CBAO for verification and issuance of notices of violation of the Building Code.
Three ongoing large constructions at Navy Base, St. Joseph Village were also issued cease and desist orders. – Jessa Samidan and Aileen Refuerzo

12,Councilors back titling some portions of Burnham Park,"April 30, 2023","Several members of the Baguio City Council lauded the initiative of the executive department to title portions of Burnham Park in the name of the city government of Baguio.
Councilor Jose Molintas said having a title over Burnham Park will allow the city government to “clear the irregularities” happening therein including illegal occupation, adding that the city government does not intend to remove the jurisdiction of the Tourism Infrastructure and Enterprise Zone Authority (Tieza) over the area.
During the regular session last April 24, the city council approved the proposed additional fund in the amount of P2 million for the titling of other portions in Burnham Park and other areas in the city that are being used by the city government. 
The recently titled portions are referred to as Burnham Lot 1 with a total area of 182,045 square meters. This lot covers the picnic grove, skating rink, the parking area fronting Tiong San Harrison, City Environment and Parks Management extension office, City Library, Burnham Lake, Children’s Playground, Orchidarium, bicycle area, Rose Garden, Melvin Jones Grandstand, food stalls, Igorot Garden, and Ibaloy Park.
The title, called Original Certificate of Title 2023000017, was issued on March 3.
After acquiring a title for Burnham Lot 1, the city government is now pursuing the titling of Burnham Park Lot 6 which covers portions of the public swimming pool, and Lions Club and Pine Trees of the World with an area of 10,021 square meters. However, City Planning and Development Officer Donna Tabangin said the Department of Environment and Natural Resources had returned the titling application of the city government for Lot 6 due to some issues with its adjacent lots.
City Administrator Bonifacio dela Peña said the city government will apply for all areas in Burnham Park that are not covered by Original Certificate Title 1.
With an area of 299,083 square meters, OCT 1 is under the Insular Government and is managed by the DENR. Portions of Burnham Park covered by OCT 1 include the Athletic Bowl and the lots where the old city library and old auditorium were located. 
These land titling initiatives were started by former mayor Mauricio Domogan and are being completed by the current administration.
Burnham Park is a historic urban park in the city covered by Proclamation 64, s. 1925, which established the Burnham Park reservation for park purposes.
The city government has been the administrator of Burnham Park since Feb. 10, 1995 pursuant to Executive Order 244 issued by then President Fidel Ramos. Prior to this, the park was under the Philippine Tourism Authority. The full control and further development of the same was finally transferred to the city government on Jan. 10, 2008 when then President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo issued Executive Order 695.
Department of Tourism Legal Officer Brenden Quintos said Tieza, during a meeting last March 29, questioned the move of the city government to have Burnham Park titled in its name and that Tieza wants to retain ownership of Burnham Park. 
Dela Peña said the city government will have a dialogue with Tieza to iron out the issue on titling.
Councilor Mylen Yaranon earlier questioned the plan to title portions of Burnham Park in the name of the city government. She asked whether a presidential proclamation can be canceled by the issuance of a land title.
She said OCT 1 was also questioned during the term of her late father, then Mayor Braulio Yaranon.
General Services Officer Eugene Buyucan, whose office is tasked to process the titling, said OCT 1 which was issued in 1910 does not supersede Proclamation 64 since the former precedes the latter.
He added acquisition of a title does not cancel Proclamation 64 as the proclamation identifies the use of an area while a title indicates who owns it. – Jordan G. Habbiling

13,Leader airs side on issues hounding Ifugao Day in city,"April 30, 2023","An Ifugao group leader refuted the claims made by another group who appeared before the city council earlier to seek the latter’s help in settling their differences.
Raul Ballogan, founder and National President of the Intermingling of Ifugao Body and Brotherhood Association, Inc. (IIBBA), has asked Ifugao residents in Baguio not to be sidetracked by the issues that tend to divide, instead of unifying them.
Ballogan reached out to the Midland Courier to air his side and clarify some of the claims made by Ifugao Brethren (FIB) headed by David Dumangeng at the city council and which was published in the paper in its April 23, 2023 issue.
The two groups could not settle their differences on the celebration of the Ifugao Day, which was set on April 29.
Dumangeng’s group asked the city council to help them settle their differences, especially on the use of the Ibaloy Heritage Garden as venue for the Ifugao Day and eventually for the groups to unite and conduct their events as one group.
Ballogan said he was for unity, which is the very reason he worked hard to form a group that would unite the Ifugaos residing in Baguio.
This is also why he gave up his reservation of the Ibaloy Garden and opted to have his group hold their version of the Ifugao Day at the Igorot Garden so the FIB can use the area and prevent aggravating the problem.
Ballogan said it is not true that he evaded invitations by the FIB for them to sit together and settle their concerns and talk about uniting.
“I sent my representatives to the meetings they initiated because I want to make it clear that when we meet, we will talk about uniting our groups, but that is not what they are discussing during meetings,” Ballogan said.
He said he is willing that the two groups merge and promote the interest of all the Ifugaos in Baguio, not just the personal interests of the officers.
The IIBBA and FIB used to be one group, but Ballogan said during the times he went to Banaue, Ifugao to seek an elective post, Dumangeng’s group elected new officers, in violation of the by-laws about the qualifications of officers.
He said Dumangeng became president of the group by virtue of succession when the elected head resigned from her post due to criticisms by members and officers of IIBBA chapters who said she was not qualified to become a federation president.
Ballogan said what’s happening with the Ifugao groups now is unfortunate, considering that his intention in forming the group was to unite all the Ifugaos.
“I worked hard to organize the Ifugaos residing in Baguio in 2004, because I wanted to replicate the unity of the people from Mountain Province who are always ready to help their provincemates who are in need or get together for fellowship,” he said.
He added he wants the Ifugaos in Baguio to be united and also look after each other and work together to promote and protect their culture.
The IIBBA and FIB staged the Ifugao Day on separate venues.
Earlier, the city council tasked the committee on indigenous peoples chaired by Councilor Maximo Hilario Edwin, Jr., to sit down with the groups and help them resolve their differences.
The councilor asked the two groups to settle their differences so that they can hold the Ifugao Day as one group. – Jane B. Cadalig

14,Human rights defenders ordinance in city pushed,"April 30, 2023","Amid various complaints related to red-tagging, threats, and harassment, the city council committee on laws and human rights has filed a proposed ordinance establishing protective mechanisms for human rights defenders in the city.
The city council approved the proposed ordinance on first reading last April 17 during its regular session.
According to Councilor Peter Fianza, chairperson of the committee, human rights defenders and progressive groups in the city have experienced human rights violations such as political vilification, unfounded red-tagging and terrorist-labeling, harassment, and intimidation.
He said these incidents had been reported to the city government and Commission on Human Rights.
Fianza said activists and human rights groups in the city such as the Cordillera Youth Center, Tongtongan ti Umili, Youth Act Now Against Tyranny Baguio-Benguet, and Cordillera Human Rights Alliance have been seeking redress and lobbying to the city council since 2018 for policies and programs protecting and promoting human rights in the city. 
The proposed ordinance seeks to protect human rights defenders in the city while awaiting the enactment of a human rights defenders’ law. 
“Baguio City commits itself as a safe space for everyone, nurturing vibrant democracy and good governance,” Fianza said.
The ordinance, once enacted, shall declare the rights and freedom of human rights defenders in the city. 
These rights and freedom are the right to promote and protect human rights and fundamental freedoms; right to form groups, associations, and organizations; right to solicit, receive, and use resources; right to seek, receive, and disseminate information; right to develop and advocate for human rights ideas; right to communicate with non-governmental, governmental, and intergovernmental organizations;
Right against vilification; right to access, communicate, and cooperate with international and regional human rights bodies and mechanisms; right to participate in public affairs; right to peaceful assembly; right to represent and advocate; right to privacy; freedom from intimidation or reprisal; right to seek or establish a sanctuary for human rights violation victims and their families; and
Freedom from defamation and stigmatization; right to exercise cultural rights and development of personality; and right to effective remedy and full reparation.
The ordinance shall also impose the obligations of public authorities in protecting human rights defenders in the city. 
These obligations include providing free access and promote materials related to human rights and fundamental freedoms; securing the non-disclosure of the sources used by human rights defenders; preventing human rights violations and ensuring protection from intimidation or reprisal; penalizing intimidation or reprisal;  desisting from derogatory and unfounded labeling; ensuring protection from arbitrary or unlawful intrusion and interference; not participating in violating human rights and fundamental freedoms; assisting in investigation; adopting human rights based governance; and promoting advocacies related to human rights.
The protective mechanisms for human rights defenders under the ordinance have four components. 
The first component is the coordination and cooperation among the city government and CHR-Baguio field office, and civil society organizations for the streamlining of human rights education and investigation of complaints on human rights violations.
The second component is the establishment of a sanctuary for high risk human rights defenders, human rights violation victims, and their families. 
The third component is the provision of psychosocial assistance for high risk human rights defenders, human rights violation victims, and their families.
The fourth component is the campaign against derogatory and unfounded labeling.
Under the ordinance, freedom parks shall be identified. These declared freedom parks may be used for peaceful assemblies.
The ordinance also contains provisions on community-based campaigns on human rights and human rights defenders; integration of activities under this ordinance into the City Development Plan and Local Youth Development Plan; and commemoration and memorialization of human rights defenders and human rights violation victims. – Jordan G.
