1,Illegal structures within Teachers Camp removed,"APRIL 16, 2023","  The City Demolition Team and City Anti-Squatting and Illegal Structures (Basis) demolished on April 13 three structures built within the Teachers’ Camp reservation without the requisite building permit and consent to construct.
The City Buildings and Architecture Office through the City Demolition Team led by Engr. Donald Gas-ib implemented Demolition Order 4, s. 2022 issued by Mayor Benjamin Magalong based on the complaints of the National Housing Authority.
The NHA is the administrator of Proclamation 613, s. 2004 which segregated and reserved 3.4 hectares of land within the Teachers’ Camp reservation for housing site purposes and for disposition to qualified beneficiaries.
The issue dates back in 2016 when NHA Region 1 and Cordillera Manager Eduardo G. Leano requested the CBAO for the immediate inspection and issuance of demolition order to an ongoing construction within the proposed/identified access road of Proclamation 613.
Records of the Project Interagency Committee (PIAC) of the NHA show notices of violation have been issued to the owner of the structure for them to stop their ongoing construction.
Considering the investigation was conducted several years back, the Anti-Squatting and Anti-Illegal Structures Committee requested the CBAO to conduct re-investigation on the structures within the proclamation to have an updated report as to the identity of the owners and the dimension of the structures and materials used.
On Oct. 19, 2021, the CBAO submitted a memorandum containing the result of the re-investigation revealing 11 structures within Proclamation 613 of NHA while the rest of the structures are within Proclamation 290 under the jurisdiction of the Department of Education particularly Teachers’ Camp Administration.
Four structures within Proclamation 613 are the priority concern of NHA described as follows:
One-story residential structure made of reinforced concrete, concrete hollow block and galvanized iron sheets with approximate measurements of eight by eight meters in footprint area, allegedly constructed sometime in 2012;
One unit comfort room made of wood, concrete hollow block and galvanized iron sheet with approximate measurements of 2.5m by 1.5m in footprint area, allegedly constructed sometime in 2016;
An unfinished one-story residential house made of reinforced concrete with approximate measurements of 9m by 6m in footprint area; and
One-story shanty made of wood and galvanized iron sheet with approximate dimension of 5m by 3m footprint area, allegedly constructed sometime in 2010.
Per certification issued by CBAO dated Oct. 18, 2021, no building permit was issued to the owners of the structures resulting in the issuance of notices of violation and the committee reiterated voluntary demolition.
However, only the owner of the shanty voluntarily demolished their structure as of December 2021.
On Dec. 2, 2021, one of the respondents requested the NHA if it is possible for the government to sell to the former that portion of the lot that they have occupied.
But the representatives of NHA answered in the negative since this would be a direct violation of Republic Act 7279 or the Urban Development Housing Act of 1992.
Also under the Policy Guidelines on Beneficiary Selection and Disposition of Homelots adopted by the PIAC, all the three structure owners are not actual occupants within the Baguio Teachers Camp reservation.
The city government will implement an aggressive operation for the demolition of illegal structures within reservations as well as stoppage of ongoing constructions without building permits. – Jessa Mardy P. Samidan  "
2,BWD’s interconnection project augments supply,"APRIL 16, 2023","UP AND RUNNING — The Baguio Water District technical team rendered overtime on Holy Thursday to complete the testing of the pipeline interconnection of the BWD Malvar tank and Old Lucban barrel. The interconnection project aims to augment water supply towards the Buyog and Pinsao-2 deepwells due to the seasonal decline of water sources during the dry season. — Mark Victor Pasagoy  The Baguio Water District has completed the pipeline interconnection project at the Old Lucban deepwell on April 6.
The project, initiated on April 4, aims to augment the reduced water yield of the Buyog and Pinsao-2 deepwells.
Problem areas in parts of Pinget, Pinsao, Fairview, Magsaysay, Quirino Hill, and Tam-awan are expected to have better water supply during water diversion schedules.
Primarily, water will be sourced from the Malvar deepwell and will be conveyed to augment the Old Lucban deepwell.
Earlier this year, BWD has been closely monitoring the gradual reduction of water produced by water sources at Buyog deepwell and spring and Pinsao-2 deepwell. As of this date, the yield reduction of the two water sources has affected the normal water supply of the areas to which these are diverted.
Through the interconnection project, BWD targets to sustain the equitable distribution of available water supply in the north-north-eastern side of Baguio City.
BWD also activated its contingency measure to augment the water supply at the BWD Sanggalang tank by means of BWD water delivery trucks. During normal operations, the Sanggalang tank fills up an average of four to 6.6 meters water level, but this was temporarily affected due to the yield reduction at the Easter, Tam-awan, and Pinsao deepwells.
Meanwhile, BWD advised the public to continue observing water conservation practices as supply is affected by the seasonal decline in water supply experienced during the dry season and will be further affected by the anticipated El Niño phenomenon as earlier announced by the Pagasa.
An artificial increase in water demand is currently experienced due to the influx of tourists, returning residents, and transients. Nevertheless, the BWD announced it is exerting its best efforts to minimize these effects and is doing all it can to serve its constituents through water supply improvement and expansion projects.
BWD customers are advised to install water storage facilities such as tanks, drums, or other containers with a three-day backup water supply as it implements a rationing system. Further, the installation of a sump tank and boosters to pump water to their elevated water storage facilities is highly encouraged as this comes as part of the standard water system set-up especially at highly elevated residences.
Commercial establishments, on the other hand, are advised to apply for additional or enlargement of their current tapping should their daily water demand increase.
For concerns and water deliveries, customers are advised to reach the following numbers which can be reached 24/7: 442-3218, 442-4929, 0908-8651-504, 0917-679-4929, 0922-840-9765, or send a message at BWD_Customer Relations Facebook page or send an email to baguiowaterdistrictgmo@gmail.com. – Press release  "
3,Dads approve P185 M fund for various projects,"APRIL 16, 2023","  The Baguio City council has approved the allocation of more than P185 million to fund various projects listed under the supplemental Annual Investment Plan (AIP), with the exception of two items worth P7M.
The supplemental budget, worth P185,120,000, covers 16 projects, but the council deferred the approval of the items concerning the development of tourist rest site at Kennon Road worth P5M and the processing of titles of parcels of land at Burnham Park in favor of the city government, which is worth P2M.
Councilor Mylen Yaranon said there was a need to ensure if the Tourism Infrastructure and Enterprise Zone Authority (Tieza) approved the planned titling of portions of Burnham Park in the name of the city government.
Under the supplemental budget, the planned titling under the city government includes the lots covering Melvin Jones, Burnham Lake, Orchidarium, Children’s Park, part of Skating Rink and Tennis Court, and parts of Pine Trees of the World Park.
For the development of the tourist rest site along Kennon Road, Councilor Benny Bomogao said the council needs to be clarified on the lease agreement the city has to sign with the Department of Environment and Natural Resources on the use of the land for the establishment of tourist rest area.
The lease agreement provides the city government must pay an annual lease of P250,000 to the DENR for the Kennon Road tourist rest area.
City Budget Officer Leticia Clemente said she had no prior knowledge about the city’s lease agreement with the DENR.
The council invited the Department of Tourismand the DENR in its next session to update members if Tieza already gave its approval for the titling of parts of Burnham Park and for the DENR to clarify the lease agreement.
The other projects to be funded by the supplemental budget are the safe and sound cities program in Baguio worth P8M; proposed Engineer’s Hill Barangay Multipurpose Complex, P10M; purchase of furniture and fixture for the newly constructed Aurora Hill Super Health Center, P4M; and repair and renovation of the vacant building at Orchidarium, Burnham Park for the livelihood of persons with disability of Burnham-Legarda-Kisad barangay, P2.3M.
The fund is also intended for the updating of the city’s Comprehensive Land Use Plan/City Development Plan worth P1M; construction of a drainage canal at an alley in Ambiong P300,000; repair and improvement of drainage system at Happy Homes Old Lucban, P9.6M; improvement of Asin District Health Center, P3M; improvement of City Camp Central Health Center, P1.8M; and classroom building renovation at Pinsao Elementary School, P4.5M.
The supplemental budget will also fund the documentary stamp tax and transfer of property of the Baguio Convention Center worth P15M, the proposed livestockecological market building at Dontogan barangay, P108M; and restoration of eroded riprap and portion of road at Honeymoon worth P620,000.
The supplemental budget was sourced from the continuing appropriations of 2020 with P108M; the 2022 surplus of the general fund, P76.5M; and from the Local Disaster Risk Reduction management Trust Fund, P620,000. – Jane B. Cadalig  "
4,Decreased crime volume reported over Holy Week,"APRIL 16, 2023","  The Baguio City Police Office headed by City Director Col. Francisco Bulwayan Jr. managed to keep crimes under control during the Holy Week despite the maximized tourism and economic activities in the city.
Bulwayan said records showed that the crime volume decreased by 27.77 percent or 10 incidents for the period of April 3 to 9 as compared to the crime figure on April 10 to 16.
Mayor Benjamin Magalong commended the BCPO and other government and private groups and individuals who served during the Holy Week exodus, saying their services were instrumental to the peaceful and orderly observance of the Lenten season and tourism activities in the city.
Index and non-index crimes both went down.
For index crimes, the BCPO documented two incidents this year compared to four last year or a 50 percent decrease. Crimes recorded under this type were robbery and physical injury and murder.
For non-index crimes, seven crime incidents were recorded this year as against last year’s 12 or a drop of 41.67 percent. Non-index crimes committed during the period were alarm and scandal, arson of property for small value, discharge of firearm, grave coercion, malicious mischief and violations of anti-child abuse and anti-gambling laws.
As to traffic incidents, the recorded cases were 12 reckless imprudence resulting in damage to property, four reckless imprudence resulting in physical injuries, and one case of reckless imprudence resulting in homicide. Last year, there were 17 reckless imprudence resulting in damage to property cases and three reckless imprudence resulting in physical injuries.
Bulwayan attributed the decrease in crime volume to the increased number of personnel and volunteer groups deployed composed of 1,574 personnel and strict implementation of enhanced management of police operations like checkpoints, Oplan Bakal Sita, police presence, foot patrol and mobile patrol. – Aileen P. Refuerzo and Mileyvonne Tiamzon  "
5,"April 21, holiday to mark Eid’l Fitr","APRIL 16, 2023","  President Ferdinand Marcos, Jr. declared April 21 as a regular holiday for the observance of Eid’l Fitr, or the culmination of the Fasting of Ramadan.
Marcos signed Proclamation 201 after the National Commission on Muslim Filipinos (NCMF) recommended for the declaration of the date as a national holiday.
“In order to bring the religious and cultural significance of the Eid’l Fitr to the fore of national consciousness and to allow the entire Filipino nation to join their Muslim brothers and sisters in peace and harmony in the observance and celebration of Eid’l Fitr, it is necessary to declare April 21, 2023, a regular holiday throughout the country,” the proclamation read.
Eid’l Fitr, one of the two most important Islamic celebrations, is observed by the Muslim community three days after the month-long Ramadan fasting.
The other important celebration, Eid al-Adha or The Feast of the Sacrifice, is celebrated on the 10th day of the last month of the Islamic calendar and commemorates the willingness of Ibrahim (Abraham) to sacrifice his son to God.
Eid al-Adha also marks the end of the Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca, the fifth pillar of Islam.
Muslim Filipinos comprise about six percent of the population.
To honor country’s Islamic heritage, the government in 2002 established Eid’l Fitr as a regular holiday by virtue of Republic Act 9177 and Presidential Proclamation 1083.
The holiday is determined by the use of the lunar-based Islamic calendar through the sighting of the crescent moon in the Islamic month of Shawwal. – PNA  "

9,"Over 7,000 senior citizens of Baguio avail of benefits","APRIL 16, 2023","  There are 7,419 senior citizens enjoying their retirement in Baguio City.
This is based on the records of the City Social Welfare and Development Office (CSWDO) on the number of identification cards issued to senior citizens for 2022.
CSWDO Gender and Equality Focal Person Myrna Valencerina said 50.14 percent of the total senior citizen population in the city are female while 49.85 percent are male.
Of the total, at least half or 4,161 are new holders of senior citizen ID; 473 transferred to Baguio from other places; while 2,785 are replacements.
Only 4,097 of the total senior citizen ID holders are social pension beneficiaries and most of them are residents of Barangay Irisan, 652. Other barangays in the top five of elderly with social pension reside in Asin Road with 250, San Luis with 166, Pinget with 151, and Fairview with 148.
The city government released a total of P1,230,000 cash incentives awarded to 123 nonagenarians (90 to 99 years old) last year while 93 females and 30 males received P10,000 each.
For the cash incentive to centenarians (100 years old and above), nine female centenarians received P100,000 each while two centenarians – a male and female – received P5,000 each for making it through another year pursuant to Ordinance 84, s. 2019.
Valencerina said the city government and concerned offices are fast-tracking the printing of movie pass booklets to implement the upgraded five-day theater admission privilege for senior citizens and persons with disability in the city.
The booklets will have to be obtained from the Office of the Senior Citizens Affairs at the Senior Citizens Center at Salud Mitra barangay for senior citizens and at the Persons with Disability Affairs Office at the City Mayor’s Office for PWDs.
Aside from movie pass, seniors and PWDs who are residents of Baguio are afforded 20 percent discount in parking fees provided that the senior citizen or the PWD is driving the vehicle based on Ordinance 149, s. 2020 which amended Ordinance 8, s. 2013. – Jessa Mardy P. Samidan  "
10,More attractions to be set up at Botanical-Centennial Park,"APRIL 16, 2023","  Plans are afoot for incorporating more “added attractions” at the city’s iconic Botanical-Centennial Park including music to enhance the experience of visitors to the popular promenade area.      
During the management committee meeting of local officials at City Hall on April 11, Mayor Benjamin Magalong directed City Environment and Parks Management Office head Rhenan Diwas to purchase the needed sound system for the purpose.      
The Cepmo manages the upkeep and overall operations of the Botanical Garden, located along Leonard Wood Road.      
Diwas informed the mayor that purchase of the sound equipment is already incorporated in his office’s budget and is undergoing the proper governmental procurement process.      
Magalong said putting additional attractions at the Botanical-Centennial Park would generate greater revenues for the city’s coffers by enticing more visitors.      
Diwas said selected musicians or buskers were temporarily allowed to play at the area and entertain promenaders while the sound system was still being purchased.      
The Botanical Garden is home to indigenous plants and flowers of the Cordillera, and is one of the city’s top tourist draws. – Gaby B. Keith  "
11,The beauty of diversity: Promoting inclusivity through body positivity,"APRIL 16, 2023","  Body positivity is a movement that has been gaining momentum in recent years, and for good reason. Society has long perpetuated unrealistic beauty standards that can have a negative impact on our self-esteem and mental health. The body positivity movement aims to challenge these standards and promote acceptance of all body types, shapes, and sizes.
Body positivity is about embracing yourself, flaws and all. It is about recognizing that we are all unique and beautiful in our own way, and that there is no such thing as a perfect body. It is about rejecting the idea that we need to conform to society’s beauty standards to be accepted and loved.
One of the key messages of the body positivity movement is that everyone deserves to be confident and comfortable in their own skin. This is particularly important for those who have historically been marginalized and excluded from mainstream beauty standards, such as people of color, people with disability, and those who are plus-size.
The body positivity movement encourages us to celebrate diversity and to embrace our own individuality. It is not about promoting unhealthy lifestyles or encouraging people to disregard their health. Rather, it is about recognizing that health comes in many different shapes and sizes, and that we should not judge others based on their appearance.
There are many ways to promote body positivity in our daily lives. One of the most important things we can do is to practice self-love and self-acceptance. This means treating ourselves with kindness and compassion, and learning to appreciate our bodies for what they are. It also means being mindful of the language we use when talking about ourselves and others, and avoiding negative self-talk or body shaming.
Another way to promote body positivity is to support brands and companies that prioritize inclusivity and diversity. This means seeking out clothing lines that offer a wide range of sizes and styles, as well as beauty products that are designed for people of all skin tones and hair textures. It also means advocating for more representation of diverse bodies in media and advertising.
The body positivity movement has come a long way, but there is still work to be done. We must continue to challenge the beauty standards that have been imposed upon us and promote acceptance and inclusivity in all aspects of society. By embracing our own unique beauty and celebrating the diversity of others, we can create a world that is truly body positive.  "
12,Agencies told to provide standards on ROW claims,"APRIL 16, 2023","  City officials requested the Baguio City District Engineering Office (BCDEO) and the Lands Management Service (LMS) of the Department of the Environment and Natural Resources for guidance on the procurements on the widths of road-right-of-way in the maintenance of national and/or city roads.         
In Resolution 197, s. 2023, the council asked the BCDEO and the LMS to clarify the rule on the measurement of road-right-of-way (ROW); exemptions to the rule; the application of Executive Order 621 which provides for national roads to have a right of way of not less than 20 meters and may further be reduced to 15m. in urban areas.
The council also wants to be clarified on how ROW maybe reserved and the difference between patented and unpatented lands affected by road widening projects.          
The city council earlier invited representatives of BCDEO, City Planning and Development Office, and the Public Order and Safety Division to clarify on the implementation of the city’s ROW infrastructure projects where various issues and concerns have been raised on the standard ROW of national and city roads.
The council expressed hope the concerned government agencies will be able to provide the legal basis in ascertaining the ROW of national and city roads for the guidance of policy-makers and decision-makers. – PIO release  "
13,Breaking free from the competition trap: Embracing life on your own terms,"APRIL 16, 2023","  The competition trap is a mindset that plagues us from a young age. Because of the belief that success is only measured by our accomplishments and being the best is the only way to get ahead in life, we are constantly pushing ourselves to be better than others. This kind of mentality is not only detrimental to our mental health but can also hinder us from leading fulfilling lives. Let’s try to explore the competition trap and how we can free ourselves from it by embracing life on our own terms.
It’s crucial to understand that life is not a competition. We are all on different paths in our lives and success should be measured by our individual goals and accomplishments, not by how we stack up against others. When we shift our focus from comparison to self-improvement and personal growth, we can find happiness and fulfillment that are true to ourselves.
One way to break free from the competition trap is by shifting from a fixed mindset to a growth mindset. A fixed mindset is the idea that our abilities and talents are set in stone, while a growth mindset suggests that we can improve and develop our skills through hard work and dedication. By adopting a growth mindset, we can focus on our own progress and development, rather than comparing ourselves to others.
Another way to break free from the competition trap is to embrace collaboration over competition. When we work with others, we can achieve great things and create something greater than ourselves. Collaboration enables us to learn from others, gain new perspectives, and achieve things that we couldn’t have achieved alone. By shifting our focus from competition to collaboration, we can live a fulfilling life and find happiness through working with others.
The competition trap is a dangerous mindset that can prevent us from leading fulfilling lives. By embracing life on our own terms and shifting our mindset to focus on personal growth and collaboration, we can break free from the competition trap and live a fulfilling life that is true to ourselves. Remember that life is not a competition, but a journey that we are all on together.  "
14,Tan anan-ak ka: Empowering the youth to become transformational leaders,"APRIL 16, 2023","  Since time immemorial, the concept of leadership in the Cordillera belongs to the elders of the community. They are known as the “manapat” (wise elder) or “lalakay” (council of elders), and they are responsible for making major political decisions. They are also the peace settlers, consultants, and the keepers of lore and tradition. Their decisions are well accepted and respected by the community.
With the changes being experienced in society’s values, practices, governance and leadership due to modernization, the youth of today becomes the frontier in filling the gaps to address current societal problems. However, their presence in politics is usually being challenged by the elders in position. Historically, the political setup has been dominated by elders. That is why the youth are being seen as “Tan anan-ak ka pay lang adem amo dana” when it comes to leadership and governance, which is why the youth also struggle to learn and develop their knowledge and skills in leadership. This scenario paralyzes and limits the ability of the youth to navigate their path in public service and understand societal issues that would help them come up with applicable, effective, and efficient solutions.
Treating them as mere children does not help in harnessing their full potential to become initiators of change the society is hoping for. Certainly youth may not have gained enough experience, but their will to help their community progress does not differ from what the elders are doing today. The youth of today are the next generation to ascend in public service. If we set aside the connotation that “tan anan-ak ka” or because they are mere kids and the norm that elders should be the decision makers, we can empower the youth in the aspect of leadership, governance, decision making, and active citizenship. This will equip them with the intellect and capabilities they need to become leaders of tomorrow. They would lead change in the community’s development.
Indeed the youth are the future of our community. With proper guidance, they can become transformational leaders that would bring progressive development in society. With their innovative and impactful ideas, they can tackle societal issues. Let the youth lead.  "
15,62 enthusiasts join in fishing tournament at Burnham Lake,"APRIL 16, 2023","  A total of 62 fishing enthusiasts from in and outside Baguio participated in the Baguio Summer Fishing Tournament last April 1 at the Burnham Park Lake.
Tournament coordinator Rafael Serrano who organized the competition in coordination with the City Environment and Parks Management Office said this so far was the highest turnout of participants almost doubling the numbers from the other three fishing events previously staged.
Participants came from Baguio; La Trinidad, Benguet; Bulacan, Pangasinan, Nueva Ecija, La Union, and Abra.
During the contest, the participants were divided into four batches of 15 and 16 members to make it to the championship round.
Each batch was given one hour to compete and each batch winner advanced to compete for the final round for another hour.
The batch winners are Clemen Encarnacion from batch 1 who accumulated a total of 36.5 inches of fish; Roden Ivan Narcilla from batch 2 who accumulated a total of 33.11 inches of fish; and John Alcantara from batch 3 and Rolly Manoquit from batch 4 who both accumulated a total of 34.5 inches of fish.
The top prize was bagged by batch 3 winner, Alcantara, who accumulated a total of 34.5 inches of fish for the final round followed by Narcilla, Manoquit and Encarnacion.
Serrano said that all four winners will take home a prize and will be awarded during the flag-raising ceremony at the Baguio City Hall on May 8.
According to Serrano, the small fishes caught by the participants were returned to the lake.
The tournament’s champion Johnjohn Alcantara, from the Bulacan-based group Baliwag Anglers, said he was pleasantly surprised to have taken the top spot since he and his group only joined for fun and experience. It was also his first time joining a fishing competition despite practicing fishing for almost three years.
Because of the increase of public interest, as well as the city’s plan to further rehabilitate the Baguio Burnham Lake, the future of fishing tournaments in the city looks bright.
Serrano plans to have another fishing tournament on June 12 and is hoping to further increase the number of participants. – Aileen Refuerzo and Paula Stephanie Morales  "
16,Longing for justice: A fractured hope,"APRIL 16, 2023","  The sound of the mallet striking the gavel resonates inside the courtroom as the judge stands and announces his decision. Family, friends, sons, and daughters wait nervously and anxiously for the outcome. The moment is an occasion that represents justice, an idea that those who are accused falsely will have their fate and hope restored and that they may be treated with respect and fairness.
People who have experienced persecution and unfairness in their lives for God knows how long have been powerless throughout their suffering and the worst feeling of being shoved on the ground. Knowing that the fire was beneath their feet, their agony lingers to the very part of their minds and souls. The bitter truth that they have witnessed of others going through punishments beyond their imagination gave shivers down their spines. These individuals’ struggle to gain the basic amenities devastated their morale in life. They have suffered for long but now, a silver lining has shown upon them, their hopeful spirits that thirst for justice is about to be quenched.
Our justice system has become more inclusive, giving everyone the right to seek the truth and the judgment they deserve. Liberty is more than just being free. It encourages the soul to sing happily, reminding us that everyone should be treated with regard. Liberty is a valuable and crucial guarantee to our society, and it is not just a matter of words.
It is said that it was never the feat of any oppressed to win the battle against the oppressor. Deeply rooted corruption is the main reason why society is in chaos. The act consumes the very core values of society, which results in havoc.
It was never an easy task to obtain the much-wanted unbiased judgment, especially in a society clouded by prejudice and tyranny. It takes tons of courage and spirit to counterflow that judicial system that carries out the self-esteem of those who have been persecuted.
These issues that have been crippling our society for years must be addressed. Let us wholeheartedly advocate for society’s tranquility. Let us charge forward with courage and not be petrified by the difficulties that we may meet along the way. Stand tall, and don’t be afraid of the questions that they will throw at you.
Justice should be objective. It should not be tainted with personal feelings nor favor those who are on the pedestal. Freedom is for everyone. It is the liberty to do what is needed to do in accordance with the norms and laws of society. Having these two will put our society into equilibrium and a sense of choice in our lives. We must continue fighting against injustice to bring forth freedom. Remember to kill your enemies with kindness and not with wickedness. We all deserve to live a decent life. We all deserve to have joy in our hearts. We all deserve to enjoy what this world will offer.
The truth will always prevail. It may take twists and turns but the innocents will come forward to claim the rightful verdict they deserve. Leo Tolstoy’s “God sees the truth but Waits” is an epitome that everything has the right timing. God sees our every tear, listens to our every prayer, and is never quiet about our pain. He is everywhere and He will deliver.  "
17,The future of hope,"APRIL 16, 2023","  Our existence is regularly tinged with distress and anguish. A few individuals are more affected by this anguish than others, yet everybody can overcome problems with hope. Hope gives us the courage to conquer the darkness and hopelessness brought on by misery and emotional pain. Hope inspires us to keep the faith and to trek onward amid obstacles that eventually prevent the journey through life, regardless of when, where, or how our daily life tale will ease.
Each of us needs it, and nearly everyone who has made it this much further in existence, has at least a certain level of hope. It is not enough to request for something to occur.
Hope is more crucial as it involves the determination to get there and the different paths you select along the situation. Numerous directions on the matter are the various choices you have along the road of life; such determinations can have a wide range of consequences.
Life has challenges, and it takes many wrong decisions to figure out the correct path. However, it lets you go down those different roads to see things wrong and find the most suitable thought. Hope is not pure fantasy or exaggeration; it is an expression, a mind frame, a faith you make your own, and an inspiration to stay the course regardless of the circumstances; you think that your journey will deal out amidst the strange occurrences that could happen along the way; and you believe that when you take your last breath, there is a more fantastic thing having to wait for you further than this universe. When you have hope, you can accomplish unimaginable feats.
We should act in order to realize our vision of hope. Everyone’s experience with satisfying our impression of hope is unique. Rather than being appreciative of what you do have, they keep hoping and wishing for what those who do not have. Regardless of what occurs, the most important thing we can do in life is to remain hopeful and believe in ourselves.
I would like to motivate you that you have value and significance, although you cannot see or acknowledge it right now. It is critical to be gentle with yourself and to take it easy. Acknowledging that things are tough right now can be helpful too. Please have faith in yourself as well as in what life may offer. Believe in your potential to navigate this challenging period. Healing is a journey that like any other, requires patience. Things will delight you, comfort you, and show you that destiny can be more vital than it appears today. Do not give up hope and remain consistent in your studies, and nothing will stop you from reaching your targets and making your goals a reality.  "
18,CEPMO stops deepwell drilling,"APRIL 16, 2023","  The City Environment and Parks Management Office issued a stoppage order to a resident drilling a deepwell in one barangay in the city.
In a report to Mayor Benjamin Magalong, Engr. Sofronio Pascua of the Cepmo said the owner was advised to secure a permit before proceeding with the drilling.
Pascua said they will continue monitoring the site and others of similar situations.
Asst. Cepmo head Marivic Empizo said illegal deepwell drilling is punishable under the Environment Code with a maximum fine of P5,000 after court procedure.
She said there is an ongoing inventory of deepwells in the city by a committee headed by the Department of the Environment and Natural Resources and Water Utilization Section under the National Water Resources Board (NWRB), and the Cepmo.
“If there are drillings reported, these are ordered to stop then monitored by barangay officials to get water drilling permits,” Empizo said.
The city government and the Baguio Water District had requested the NWRB to address the proliferation of illegal deepwells in the city being one of the causes of the declining yield of water as these deplete the recharge of underground sources resulting to the decline in pumping water levels.
In 2021, the city listed a total of 210 permitted water companies drawing from the city’s aquifers while the number of those that do not have permit was still not determined. – Aileen P. Refuerzo  "

Folayang first trained in the same gym that produced world MMA champions in 2018. — Contributed photo   Former ONE Championship world champions Eduard Folayang and Joshua Pacio have started their cross training in the United States, starting at Jackson Wink in Albuquerque, New Mexico. It was not immediately known how long the two former Team Lakay stars will train at the famous mixed martial arts gym that produced world champions. What is certain is that Folayang and Pacio will cross train in various gyms for two months while waiting for a call from ONE on when the schedule of their next bouts. The duo flew to the U.S. more than a month after they formally announced their departure from Team Lakay, which they represented in their quest for pride and glory in at least two MMA promotions. Up to now, the circumstances that led to their departure still baffle journalists. The 38-year-old Folayang will have no problem finding someone to spar with, as most MMA gyms have fighters competing in the lightweight division. The 27-year-old Pacio might find sparring with Ultimate Fighting Championship veteran John Dodson, as few fighters at Jackson Wink are competing in the strawweight division. Folayang and Pacio were earlier reported to be planning to visit Kings MMA in Huntington Beach in Los Angeles after their stint at Jackson Wink. The Filipino fighters are also scheduled to be in the cage side when ONE Championship makes its inaugural event on U.S. soil in Bloomfield, Colorado on May 5.

22,Kingad has no problem fighting top contenders,"APRIL 16, 2023","READY FOR ANYONE — Team Lakay’s Danny Kingad claims he is ready to fight anyone in the list of contenders for the ONE flyweight world belt after his ranking in the division improved following his impressive victory against Indonesian world-class wrestler Eko Roni Saputra in Bangkok, Thailand recently. — ONE photo   Former ONE flyweight world title contender Danny Kingad of Team Lakay said he is ready to fight any ranked fighter in his bid to get closer to another title shot. As one of the most talented fighters on ONE Championship’s mixed martial arts roster, his well-rounded skill set has helped him rack up a record of 15 wins and three losses while securing the third spot in the ever-changing flyweight rankings. Most recently, the 27-year-old native of Sadanga, Mountain Province proved he still belongs among the division’s elite despite coming off a 14-month layoff by dominating Indonesian bruiser Eko Roni Saputra over the course of three rounds to cruise to a clear-cut unanimous decision victory. At this point, Kingad is within shouting distance of a ONE flyweight world title shot.  The three potential opponents that would offer enthralling matchups for the beloved Team Lakay member as he looks to thrust himself into the championship picture are Hu Yong, Tatsumitsu Wada, and Gurdarshan Mangat. Hu Yong has been a wanted man in Benguet since he authored a highlight-reel knockout at the expense of Geje Eustaquio, Kingad’s stablemate, back in December. The impressive win over Eustaquio has certainly raised Hu’s stock, and it could lead him to a collision course with Kingad. Wada is no stranger to Kingad as both men first crossed paths in January 2019, with the latter winning by unanimous decision to book his spot in the ONE flyweight world grand prix. A rematch between Kingad and Wada makes the most sense this year, and it would be interesting to see which competitor dictates the action this time around. Mangat was originally booked to duke it out with Kingad at ONE 164 this past December, but the Indian-Canadian sensation pulled out of the bout due to an injury. There is a great chance that both men can finally tangle to determine who moves up in the pecking order of a stacked weight class. – Harley F. Palangchao  "

The former Team Lakay fighter has been training hard to improve his grappling and ground game. — Contributed photo   Former ONE bantamweight world champion Kevin Belingon is seriously working on his ground game extensively during his off-season as he received a blue belt in Brazilian jiu jitsu last week. The 35-year-old spitfire from Kiangan, Ifugao was promoted by Prof. Gibran Langbayan, who possesses a stellar credential as a submission grappler and a black belt under Prof. Leonardo Fernandes. Langbayan, who earned the distinction as the first BJJ black belt from the Cordillera, awarded the new rank to Belingon at the Maharlika Martial Arts Center.  “It was an unforgettable surprise,” Belingon said of his promotion. Belingon began his training in jiu jitsu in 2007, the same year he turned pro in mixed martial arts. However, his focus was on his prizefighting career. Belingon has faced a long list of elite submission artists inside the ONE circle, including Masakazu Imanari, Masakatsu Ueda, Toni Tauru, Reece McLaren, and Bibiano Fernandes. Even though he has defeated opponents with exceptional grappling backgrounds, Belingon is aware that he still needs to improve in this area. Last December, he decided to join Langbayan’s classes to advance his skills on the mat. Little did he know that he was ripe to transition from white to blue in only four months. “This achievement is meaningful to me. All the hard work, the late nights, and the sacrifices are worth it,” he said. “I still have a long way to go, but I am a patient man. I’m willing to put in the work to get there,” he added. Belingon was last seen in action in November, bowing to South Korean hard-hitter Kim Jae Woong by way of first-round technical knockout. He plans to kickstart his road to redemption later this year. “The priority, of course, is my MMA career. I am here to prove that I’m not yet done and I still have a lot to offer,” Belingon said. – Carlo Quinto  "
25,WEEK’S MAIL,"APRIL 16, 2023","  Bayanihan paves way for crucial road project in Buguias A group of farmers in Amlimay, Buguias, Benguet, worked together to construct an estimated four kilometers of farm-to-market road (FMR).
Amlimay is one of the farthest barangays in Buguias. The indigenous Kalanguya people, who are distinguished by their distinctive culture and practices, reside in the mountainous valley. They contribute to the growing industry of cacti and succulents and are known for producing highland vegetables.
Sitio Kimpit is a small community that depends on farming as its major source of income. However, farmers continue to face difficulties because of the unpaved FMR.
While there are government projects on FMR, a resident said they cannot rely solely on the government because other roads also need rehabilitation and repair.
As a result, these farmers agreed to donate P5,000 per household for the road’s improvement. A total of P166,250 was received and spent on food and cement. Concerned citizens also donated.
Resident Ellen Waclin expressed her happiness that what they have longed for is finally happening. She said the construction became possible because of the cooperation of the community.
On April 7, construction started. Parents, farmers, and young people volunteered to help. This practice embodies bayanihan.
Being a native of this town, I take pride in the support system that has been established despite the generational gap. With the newly-improved road, farmers are now guaranteed safe and efficient travel when they transport their products to the market.
Bayanihan is not declining but rather sustained among this indigenous community whenever the need arises, both in terms of labor-sharing and financial support.
May this empower our kakailian to uphold the essence of bayanihan, which has an impact on social growth and resilience. May it also serve as a call to action for our local government to provide support and interventions for the expansion of FMR routes in the remote areas. — NOVELYN A. BALANGUI, Buguias, Benguet  "

28,Justification sought on Tax Code revision,"APRIL 16, 2023","  The city council has asked the City Treasury Office to further justify its request for the body to pass an ordinance that sought to amend Baguio’s more than 20-year-old Tax Ordinance.
During their special session on April 13, members of the city council said they need data that would serve as their basis in facilitating the approval of the proposal to adjust the fees collected under the Tax Code.
Mayor Benjamin Magalong earlier asked the council to give preference to the passage of the proposed amendment of the Tax Ordinance.
Councilor Peter Fianza said the council should understand first why the city government needs to amend its Tax Ordinance so that members would also know how to explain to stakeholders when the proposal is ripe for public consultation.
He said while it is given that the proposed amendment will involve increase in taxes, fees, and other charges, this must have a basis, which must be presented to the public to convince them on why the increase is needed.
The council wants the CTO to present the percentage in the increase of taxes and other fees, projection on how much the city government will collect from the adjustment, and how it will impact on the stakeholders, among other things.
“We want to be apprised of the effects of the proposed amendment. How will it affect stakeholders, how many percent is the increase, what is the projection of your office on how much will be collected from the increase compared to how much is being collected under the present ordinance? We need all these figures so that we can deliberate, or at least we know the impact of this proposed ordinance,” Fianza said.
Assistant City Treasurer Fernando Ragma, Jr. said the data requested was not yet available, but he added the proposed amendment will definitely increase the revenue of the city government.
He added it is high time for Baguio to amend its Tax Ordinance, which was approved in 2000, to make it responsive to the present.
Councilor Vladimir Cayabas asked the CTO to present a comparison of the taxes currently collected with that of the taxes to be collected under the proposed ordinance for appreciation and understanding.
Councilor Michael Lawana shared the view that the council needs to understand the basis of the tax percentage contained in the proposed amendment.
As an example, he said the proponents must explain why the percentage of tax increase imposed on establishments engaged in food business vary from those that provide accommodation services.
“We need to understand the basis because this will be the first questions that the public will ask if ever, we present this for consultation,” he said.
The city council will again invite the CTO and members of the Local Finance Committee to guide the body on how contents of the proposed amendment to the Tax Ordinance. – Jane B. Cadalig  "

Emocling has been guided by 1967 Bar topnocther and now Narvacan, Ilocos Sur Mayor Pablito V. Sanidad, Sr., also former dean of the UB School of Law. — PVS handout photo  Dream, work hard, and never give up.
Anthony Mark Dulawan Emocling, a graduate of the University of Baguio School of Law, made history for being the first visually-impaired to pass the Bar exams.
Emocling is one of the 3,992 examinees who hurdled the 2022 Bar exams, the second edition of the computerized and regionalized test administered by the Supreme Court. His name appeared at 1407 in the list of Bar passers.
His is one of the many stories that prove unfavorable circumstances in life are not hindrances to achieving one’s aspirations.
His dream of becoming a lawyer was fueled by his disability.
“I wanted to prove that people with visual impairment are not intellectually incapable. After all, the study and practice of law is more of a mind work, not visual,” Emocling said.
Emocling earned his Bachelor’s degree in Political Science and graduated with academic distinction of cum laude, also from UB. He finished his Law studies in 2017.
Like many others, his journey to becoming a lawyer was tough, made doubly hard by his situation.
“But I had to keep going because one who dreams big should not let his disability be a hindrance to achieving his goal,” he said.
Since Saint Louis University, the nearest testing center for him, is not equipped for assisted examination, Emocling took the test at the Ateneo de Manila University, where his mother had to leave him at the university entrance and in the care of a runner assigned by the Supreme Court who would accompany him to the examination center.
During the test, someone reads him the question and he dictates his answer to be encoded by another staff.
Once a student of human rights lawyer and former UB School of Law dean Pablito V. Sanidad Sr., Emocling said he wants to focus on human rights and “fight for the marginalized.”
His message to students who dream of someday joining the legal profession: “Never give up. Keep fighting despite life’s unfavorable circumstance.”
It was also Sanidad, now mayor of Narvacan, Ilocos Sur, who broke the news to the Midland Courier about the triumph of Emocling, who he guided when he was taking up Law.
Emocling is one of the 21 UB School of Law graduates who hurdled the 2022 Bar exams.
Saint Louis University meanwhile produced the top 18 in the examinations in Eric Pamintuan Exiomo who earned a rating of 86.4918 percent.
Residents from nearby Cervantes, Ilocos Sur also took to the social media, including the Midland Courier Facebook account, to proudly announce that one of its sons Kyle Terence Amilao Viloria is the top 20 in the 2022 Bar exams with a rating of 86.3334 percent.
Viloria is a grandson of the late Cervantes Mayor Rufino Lacbongan Amilao, who once traced his roots to the old Mountain Province. – Jane B.Cadalig  "
30,‘City needs young legislative leaders’,"APRIL 16, 2023","  In the elections of 2025, there should be more young elected leaders at least at the city’s legislative body.
Leaders who possess the heart for genuine public service, dynamic, and uncompromising are the kind of leaders needed to transform the Philippines into a graft-free country, Mayor Benjamin Magalong said in the Adenauer Young Leaders Program organized by Konrad Adenauer Stiftung-Philippines on April 1.
Speaking before 60 fellows composed of elected officials, student leaders, and young development workers, Magalong said these qualities are mostly possessed by the youth, and which he believes that if there are more youth leaders, positive transformation in governance will be realized.
But rather than wait for the “future” until the youth of today are given opportunity to govern, Magalong said the time should be now. “I believe in young people. I see innovation, dynamism, courage. They have a different perspective. They want change.”
For Baguio, the mayor said he hopes that by 2025, 20 percent of the city council should be made up of youth leaders.
Currently, only Sangguniang Kabataan Federation president Levy Lloyd Orcales, who is in his early 30s, falls within the range of a youth leader at the city council. The rest of the members are in their mid-40s up to mid-60s.
Orcales, who was one of the speakers in the forum, said getting elected at such a young age is a tall order, especially when the electorate votes those who have a long history in politics.
In the 2022 elections, Orcales gunned for a regular post at the city council but lost. He said the thousands of likes and messages of support he got on social media did not translate to actual votes.
He said his experience mirrors the fact that while today’s youth are active on social media, getting them to move and actually practice those that they say online are different.
“Virtual engagement does not actually translate to actual participation,” Orcales said, pointing out that there are those who even engage in supposed “activism” but for profit or income and those who only follow trending topics on social media rather than actually researching about a topic to be better appraised of the situation and where they can form their own opinion.
While acknowledging that social media has become a powerful platform to make the voices of the public be heard, Orcales said the youth need more education on how to properly and responsibly use social media.
The same happens in Cambodia said Chhayheng Soth, programme officer of the Konrad Adenauer Stiftung-Cambodia, to the point that often, too much discussion happens on social media based on incomplete information.
Similar to what the SK president of Baguio said, Chhayheng said educating the youth about the proper use of social media is necessary to have a meaningful and educated discourse on various topics.

31,"PRC: Medical emergency top priority, not donors","APRIL 16, 2023","  Even regular blood donors are not given special accommodation when it is their time to avail of blood.
Red Cross officials and volunteers clarified that in the issuance of blood, the humanitarian organization does not give priority to those who regularly donate blood if their request is not considered emergency.
“At Red Cross, medical priorities prevail. Even if you are a regular blood donor if your circumstance is not serious, you will not be prioritized,” said Carlos Canilao, chair of Red Cross-Baguio board of directors.
The clarification was made to correct the misconception that the blood donated at Red Cross are reserved for the regular donors, their relatives, or people whom they will endorse.
“The basic principle of Red Cross is that, whoever needs blood the most will be given the blood immediately. Even family members of regular blood donors are not prioritized if their case is not serious, based on the assessment of doctors,” Canilao, a regular donor, said.
He said there was a need to explain how Red Cross prioritizes the giving of blood because there are individuals who complain they are not immediately accommodated when they request for blood, if they are relatives of the donor, or they were endorsed by a regular blood donor.
Ryan Mangusan, vice chair of Red Cross-Baguio BOD, shared the view, saying the blood are not stored for those who donated them.
“We have to understand that a lot of people need blood every day, so we should not expect that the blood we donate can be stored for a longer duration. Nagkakaubusan ng dugo including type O that is considered the universal blood type,” Mangusan said.
The Red Cross officials said this should not discourage qualified individuals from donating blood. Instead, they said the donors should think about the lives they help save with their donation.
Red Cross Baguio Administrator Jennelyn Terre said donating blood is a humanitarian act and those who donate are helping ensure that blood is readily available in times of emergency.
She also clarified the fees collected from those availing blood from Red Cross are not for the payment of the blood units. The amount covers the costs that are associated with the collection, testing and preparing the components of blood.
She said even in hospitals where donors may go directly to donate blood for a patient, payment for the processing of the blood are added to the bills.

The DOT-Cordillera encouraged the region’s tourism offices to submit project proposals for the initiative that aims to incentivize tourism development in cities and municipalities.
The DOT-Cordillera, in its Facebook account, echoed the call of Sec. Christina Garcia Frasco for LGUs to join the challenge in which they are encouraged to come up with tourism-related projects that support growth in their respective areas while helping the national economy.
Through the TCC, the DOT will provide technical assistance and funds for the implementation of tourism project proposals.
The DOT has allotted P180 million through the Tourism Infrastructure and Enterprise Zone Authority (Tieza) to be used to reward LGUs that can come up with quality project proposals.
“By improving local competencies with the guidance of the DOT and support from Tieza, the TCC is envisioned to produce excellent and notable tourism projects, incorporating sustainable, inclusive, and resilient strategies,” the DOT said.
Each island region of the country will have LGU representatives that will receive prizes for the first to fifth place winners.
The LGUs with the best proposal will get P20M, while the second-place winners will receive P15M.
Third-place winners will receive P10M, fourth-place winners will get P8M and fifth-place winners will be given P7M.
The DOT said the TCC presents a significant opportunity for LGUs to promote their areas as tourist destinations and contribute to the overall growth of the country’s tourism industry.
“The TCC is expected to be a game-changer for the Philippine tourism industry and provide LGUs with a platform to showcase their tourism potential,” it added.
The challenge comes in five phases. The first phase involves the call for and submission of project proposals that will end on June 15. Announcement of the 15 selected proposals is expected on the last week of July.
The second phase will be capacity building followed by the presentation, ranking, and awarding of the proposals.
The fourth phase will involve the signing of memorandum of agreement and implementation of the tourism project while the last phase will be the inauguration and turn over. – Jane B. Cadalig  "

Bontoc Information Officer Alpine Malwagay said the accumulated donations were from private individuals, organizations, agencies, and others since they launched the “Og-ogfo the Ifontok Way” donation drive for those affected by the fire at Sitio Loc-ong in Poblacion.
Malwagay said there were 24 totally burned establishments and residential houses and 10 partially-burned establishments and houses. These resulted in the displacement of 96 families or 194 individuals. 
Also, 11 vehicles including tricycles were destroyed during the fire that occurred at 2 a.m. and lasted for five hours before being declared out at 7:20 a.m.
The Bureau of Fire Protection-Mountain Province stated the fire reached a second alarm status, thus needing augmentations from nearby fire stations in Sadanga, Sabangan, Bauko, and Sagada.
Other organizations also helped in putting out the fire including the Bontoc Water Delivery Organization, Philippine National Police, local government offices, Mountain Province State Polytechnic College Criminology interns, and civilian volunteers.      
Investigation regarding the cause and total cost of damage of the fire is ongoing.
On April 12, elders led by former municipal indigenous peoples mandatory representative George Luis Fakat performed a “changtey” or cleansing ritual.
The ritual is done in unexpected difficulties in the community where elderly men butcher a chicken and offer it to Kafunyan (supreme god). Six native chickens and six etag were required for the ceremony.
Tengaw, or community cultural lockdown, followed the ritual on April 13 until April 15 where the community rested from work or clearing and rehabilitation works at the site, as a customary rule to pay respect to the ritual conducted.
The clearing and construction of temporary shelters for the fire victims resumed on April 16.

35,Deconstructing a snack,"APRIL 16, 2023","The beginning of the snack with fries, nachos, and glazed chicken bites to be dipped in the cheddar, parmesan, and sharp cheese topped fondue.  Sometimes there is time to eat a snack only. The cheese lover that I am, I couldn’t resist the appealing fondue that everyone was enjoying at Everything but Cheese.
Of course, the commercial version of cheese never measures up to the real dairy-based editions. The texture is what makes it appealing, salty, gooey, and creamy. With each year that passes, cheese seems to have transitioned from the hard types like parmesan to the almost liquid types in tubes and bottles. This is what is used to fill the center of the bun that serves as the container of the main ingredient, cheese fondue.
In this three-cheese fondue, the French fries are perfectly sized in long strips to dip, bite, and chew. The bits of parmesan sprinkled on the top of the bun add flavor to the potatoes that are newly fried. This is picked up with a gloved hand to avoid the mushy stuff on one’s fingers. To complement the carbohydrates is the honey chicken nuggets. This crispy sweet bite sized protein part of the food in the box dipped in the thickening cheese blends well with the salty dip. Almost like chips, the dark caramelized batter and tender chicken inside still have the charm of snacking.
Of course, nachos is a must in a snack. The square shaped chips made from flour give the experience a light crisp texture with a chewy topping. This is easily coated by the cheese dip and popped into the mouth then noisily eaten. The flavor of the nachos is of the popular and common type. This snack is actually bland and is made exciting by all the types of dips like tomatoes with onions and relish or the mayonnaise kind. To me, cheese is still my favorite. This should have had onion rings but given the price and availability of the onions, the cashier apologized for its omission and said that additional nachos would be used to make up for the lack. I am not a big fan of onions and didn’t mind. But given the mild sweetness ofonions wrapped in a crispy batter, the cheese would have blended well with this too.
The sweet and pillowy bun is the last part of the snack that should be eaten. The cheese that lines it is enough to make the last part of the snack tasty. This is also used to mop up the remaining cheese at the bottom of the waxed paper box. If one could eat the bun as well, there could be no trace of anything but the plastic glove with the leftover cheese in this light but filling foodstuff. This is accompanied by brewed coffee for me but there are juices and teas that should please a diner.
In all, this carbo loading is varied compared to sitting down with a bag of chips and soda. The interesting parts of the boxed meal or snack say a lot about the present generation of eaters. They like their meals as full flavored and textured. Elements should blend well and taste good. There should be changes in each mouthful while browsing through the images in the cellphone.

LTFRB-CAR Director Lalaine Sobremonte said phase 3 of the PUV service contracting will continue with the remaining P700 million fund which will be distributed nationwide. The program is expected to start by the later part of April until June. Sobremonte said the phase 4 of the program, which has a P2 billion budget, will be implemented from July to December this year.  Phase 3 of the program will continue the “libreng sakay” while in phase 4, commuters would now be paying the PUVs who are under the service contract of the government.  Sobremonte clarified the LTFRB is waiting for the guidelines from the national office for the implementation of phases three and four. “We are waiting for the guidelines but there are initial talks that the libreng sakay would be provided during the holidays,” Sobremonte said.  The service contracting program would include high-impact areas or the highly-urbanized cities where transportation is needed. She said the program would also help the traditional public utility jeepney drivers to raise funds with the ongoing PUV Modernization Program. The service contracting program was extended and appropriated with budget by lawmakers, seeing the ease it provided to the commuting public especially in the highly-urbanized areas of the country.  The libreng sakay is a joint program of the Department of Transportation and the LTFRB to help commuters cope with the rising prices of commodities and services. It was launched in late 2020 under Republic Act 11494, or the Bayanihan to Recover as One Act. Congress earlier allocated funds to ensure the continuation of the program this year with a P2.16B budget included in the P5.268 trillion General Appropriations Act of 2023.

42,Marcos assures no rice shortage in coming months,"APRIL 16, 2023","  President Ferdinand R. Marcos, Jr. assured the public there would be no rice shortage in the country in the coming months. Marcos gave the assurance following his meeting with officials of the Department of Agriculture and National Food Authority at Malacañan Palace. He said the country’s rice supply situation is in “good shape”, as he noted that the government is implementing measures to control the price of rice. “Hindi tayo magkukulang sa bigas. At tinitingnan natin lahat ng paraan upang ang presyo ay ma-control natin at hindi naman masyadong tataas,” Marcos said. Under the DA 2023 supply outlook, the country’s total supply is at 16.98 million metric tons (MMT), which is sufficient to cover this year’s demand estimated at 15.29 MMT. Based on this data, the DA said the country would have an ending balance of 1.69 MMT, which is equivalent to 45 days of buffer stock, instead of the 90-day ideal buffer stock to stabilize the price of rice. Marcos, however, pointed out that the NFA should build up its buffer stocks sourced from local farmers for now. He also noted that while the government would still have to consider importation, the volume of rice allowed to enter the country has dropped significantly. “Magpa-plano kami kung kailangan mag-import, kung kailangan magpahaba, magparami ng buffer stock sa NFA dahil masyado ng mababa. ‘Yun lang ang nakita naming problema, mababa ‘yung buffer stock ng NFA,” he said. He said the government will try to prevent the rise in rice prices if they try to increase the country’s rice stockpile. “Kaya’t ‘yun ang hinahanapan namin ng paraan para i-adjust. Siguro ang magagawa natin ay ang pagbili ay hindi bigla. Hindi malaki. ‘Yun lamang,” he said. The NFA is proposing the importation of 330,000 MT of rice to cover an expected deficit in the country’s buffer stock for the relief operations of various agencies in the event of calamities this year. Agriculture officials said the proposed buffer stock of rice is equivalent to nine days of national consumption from July 2023 onwards and will ensure sufficient volume for calamity and relief requirements from July to December this year. Given the NFA’s budgetary constraints, the agency expects its buffer stocks will decrease to less than 500,000 sacks by July 2023, which is equivalent to less than a day of public consumption. As of April 6, the Bureau of Plant Industry has issued 989 Sanitary and Phytosanitary Import Clearance (SPSIC) applications for 3.170 MMT volume of rice applied out of the 3,024 SPSICs. Of this volume, 790,449.12 MT of imported rice has arrived. Among those who met the President were Agriculture Senior Usec. Domingo Panganiban, Undersecretary Leocadio Sebastian, Usec.

It also involves the identification of possible projects for the barangays and assessment needs of the community by the local officials and other stakeholders. Priority projects identified by the barangays in the RCSP and aligned with the Barangay Development Plan are usually implemented under the Support to Barangay Development Program (SBDP) of the National Task Force to End Local Communist Armed Conflict. Aside from the 12 barangays, six more barangays in the province submitted a list of projects under the same program and are currently waiting for further instructions from the DILG.

Emocling has been guided by 1967 Bar topnocther and now Narvacan, Ilocos Sur Mayor Pablito V. Sanidad, Sr., also former dean of the UB School of Law. — PVS handout photo  Dream, work hard, and never give up.
Anthony Mark Dulawan Emocling, a graduate of the University of Baguio School of Law, made history for being the first visually-impaired to pass the Bar exams.
Emocling is one of the 3,992 examinees who hurdled the 2022 Bar exams, the second edition of the computerized and regionalized test administered by the Supreme Court. His name appeared at 1407 in the list of Bar passers.
His is one of the many stories that prove unfavorable circumstances in life are not hindrances to achieving one’s aspirations.
His dream of becoming a lawyer was fueled by his disability.
“I wanted to prove that people with visual impairment are not intellectually incapable. After all, the study and practice of law is more of a mind work, not visual,” Emocling said.
Emocling earned his Bachelor’s degree in Political Science and graduated with academic distinction of cum laude, also from UB. He finished his Law studies in 2017.
Like many others, his journey to becoming a lawyer was tough, made doubly hard by his situation.
“But I had to keep going because one who dreams big should not let his disability be a hindrance to achieving his goal,” he said.
Since Saint Louis University, the nearest testing center for him, is not equipped for assisted examination, Emocling took the test at the Ateneo de Manila University, where his mother had to leave him at the university entrance and in the care of a runner assigned by the Supreme Court who would accompany him to the examination center.
During the test, someone reads him the question and he dictates his answer to be encoded by another staff.
Once a student of human rights lawyer and former UB School of Law dean Pablito V. Sanidad Sr., Emocling said he wants to focus on human rights and “fight for the marginalized.”
His message to students who dream of someday joining the legal profession: “Never give up. Keep fighting despite life’s unfavorable circumstance.”
It was also Sanidad, now mayor of Narvacan, Ilocos Sur, who broke the news to the Midland Courier about the triumph of Emocling, who he guided when he was taking up Law.
Emocling is one of the 21 UB School of Law graduates who hurdled the 2022 Bar exams.
Saint Louis University meanwhile produced the top 18 in the examinations in Eric Pamintuan Exiomo who earned a rating of 86.4918 percent.
Residents from nearby Cervantes, Ilocos Sur also took to the social media, including the Midland Courier Facebook account, to proudly announce that one of its sons Kyle Terence Amilao Viloria is the top 20 in the 2022 Bar exams with a rating of 86.3334 percent.

Folayang shared he and Clarin touched on several topics during their meeting, including his future plans as a competitor and the current framework of mixed martial arts in the country. “I am thrilled that we had a smooth conversation with Chairman Clarin. I felt how welcoming GAB is, which signifies a good sign for all professional athletes,” Folayang said. “We were also assured by the chairman himself that he would listen to our concerns and safeguard our welfare. In fact, they even said that GAB’s function doesn’t stop at handing out licenses,” he added. GAB, as the local regulatory body of professional sports, has already laid out several plans to nurture the growth of MMA in the Philippines. One of them is a coordinated effort by GAB and the sport’s stakeholders to establish an official ranking system for fighters. Folayang believed Clarin’s vision for MMA in the Philippines would benefit all sectors of the industry, not just himself and his fellow homegrown talents strutting their wares under the ONE Championship banner. “The fact that there are people like Chairman Clarin who have opened doors and do not have second thoughts to listen to us, is heartwarming. He wants to remind us of our rights as professional athletes,” the pride of Sadanga, Mountain Province said. In early March, Folayang announced his departure from Team Lakay, ending his 16-year relationship with the stable that he helped build from the ground up. At the time of his exit, many wondered where he could be headed as Folayang received numerous invitations from notable names such as former rival Martin Nguyen and women’s MMA pioneer Cris Justino. Folayang revealed he would be exploring training overseas alongside Pacio. “That’s the target – to fly to the States, visit several gyms over there, and maximize all the opportunities we’ll get to elevate our skills,” he said. – ONE release  "

56,The miracle that is Christ,"APRIL 9, 2023","  (Editors’ note: The Midland Courier is reprinting the columns of the late Atty. Benedicto T. Carantes as a tribute to one of its long-time columnists. This piece was published on April 9, 2017.) Jesus Christ was born man amidst very humble beginnings. He lived for 33 years on a planet called Earth, but in His rather short life, he did a few remarkable feats deemed miracles by His faithful followers.
If our count is correct, He performed no less than five miracles, although there were claims He likewise cured the sick, made the blind see, and rid lepers of their scourge. The following are His better known miracles:
Changing water into wine during a wedding at Cana
Oh, as an aside, it is said that was His own wedding, (presumably to Mary Magdalene, but which came first, Cana, or Jesus saving Mary Magdalene from being stoned by an angry mob) since His mother worried about the wine running out, something that invited guests would not trouble themselves with, so it was Mary, acting as host, who informed her son about the wine no longer flowing.
But then Mary was such a kindhearted soul, ever ready to help others in distress, significant or trivial, like wine no longer pouring. Unbelievers argue, however, that even so, Jesus was not the Son of God, there being no God or a Supreme Being capable of creating an entire world. Maybe he was an alien from outer space, or someone who managed to travel from the future to the past.
Quite easy for a being like that to change the color and taste of the water by just dropping powdered Jello. A guest who had one too many would never notice the difference.
Walking on water
An alien or time traveler would know about the gravity of the moon causing sea water to recede, so Jesus actually waded through shallow waters during low tide. But were not the soles of His feet on the water?
Multiplying bread and fish
This miracle was said to have happened during Jesus’ Sermon on the Mount.
The explanation given is that you stock up on food when you expect a large multitude to attend your sermon, half believers, half just curious.
The only way you can keep the crowd from dispersing when they are feeling hot and hungry is to bring out the food prepared earlier.
No one actually saw Jesus multiply the fish and loaf, but Jesus was not a magician with props, and the last thing He would do is to trick His faithful followers.
Miracle or whatever, the people didn’t go home hungry. They needed to be fed, and so they were. Bringing Lazarus back from the dead
As the sisters of Lazarus Mary and Martha told Jesus, His friend died because He wasn’t around.
This implies that Jesus was aware of Lazarus’ sickly condition. Lazarus was epileptic and suffered an attack that made him comatose.
It was only a matter of time when Lazarus would recover, and at the first stirring of movement, Jesus commanded Lazarus to rise, who then opened his eyes, and was soon back on his feet.
The resurrection of Jesus
This is the miracle that belies all the silly arguments regarding His earlier miracles.
Surprised and even afraid that Jesus or His body was no longer in His tomb, these eyewitnesses would later meet and see Jesus along the road, and were amazed that His body bore no blemishes, no open wound on His ribcage pierced by the spear of a Roman centurion, and there was a radiance about Him that they couldn’t explain or even describe.
The question is asked, however, why was His body entombed and not just wrapped in a blanket to be thrown in the forest or desert and be devoured by scavenging wolves, He being a charlatan and all. Mary, Jesus’ mom, made all the necessary arrangements for Her son to be given a proper burial, including the site of His final resting place. Her request was not denied by the guilt stricken Roman authorities, having earlier condemned an innocent man to His death.
For one who suffered crucifixion thrice, the first during the Agony in the Garden, knowing how much He would suffer at the hands of His tormentors; the second was when He was nailed to the cross that He carried all the way to Mount Cavalry; and the third and most painful of all, the people that He suffered and died for to redeem them from sin continue to betray Him with their lust and greed for wealth and power.
Ah, but even Peter denied the Lord three times, and told Peter so – as the cock would crow thrice, and He likewise knew that Judas would betray Him with a kiss. So, is there still hope for mankind? Only with the second coming of Christ.
Today, Palm Sunday marks the start of the Holy Week. Remember, dear faithful, that repentance alone, without amending your life, will not bring you to Paradise.
And for all your skepticism and lack of faith, Jesus has made your heart His abode.
No way you can evict Him.
Have a truly Holy Week!  "
57,"SSS members’ investment, savings reaches P35 billion","APRIL 9, 2023","PAY YOUR CONTRIBUTIONS — Six employers were summoned by the Social Security System La Trinidad branch to settle their accumulated contribution delinquencies worth P700,000 during the Run after Contribution Evaders campaign on March 23.  SSS has been exerting efforts to go after delinquent employers. — Contributed photo  Social Security System President and Chief Executive Officer Rolando Macasaet said the total member savings collection from the Workers’ Investment and Savings Program (WISP) reached P35.84 billion from 4.9 million SSS members in its second year of implementation.
Macasaet said savings collection under the WISP has more than doubled since the start of the program in 2021.
“From January to December 2021, we initially collected P15.48B. In 2022, the savings collection grew by 31 percent to P20.4B which brought the total WISP contributions to P35.84B,” Macasaet said.
Moreover, members contributing to the WISP also grew to 4.9 million contributing members, up by 33 percent from 3.7 million members in 2021.
WISP is a mandatory provident fund scheme managed by SSS that serves as another savings for private sector workers and other individual paying members which was launched in January 2021. It promotes the principle of work, save, invest and prosper so that members can have a better retirement package aside from their regular SSS benefit.
WISP is one of the key provisions under Republic Act 11199 or the Social Security Act of 2018. It is a safe, convenient, principal-protected, and tax-free individual retirement savings plan which will supplement a member’s savings from their regular social security program.
“Under the WISP, each contributing member will have an account wherein SSS will place their contributions and investment earnings. Not only are they saving for their retirement, but their contributions are also earning through the program,” Macasaet added.
Qualified are private-sector employees, self-employed individuals, overseas workers, and voluntary members who have no final claim and have contributions in the regular SSS program, and have a monthly salary credit that exceeds P20,000.
Members pay their WISP contributions together with their regular SSS contributions.
Aside from serving as a savings scheme, the SSS chief said the program also functions as an investment vehicle for SSS members. The SSS pools the contributions collected from the program and invests them in the capital markets. Earnings realized from the WISP will be distributed proportionately based on the member’s contributions.
Members can check their WISP contribution online through their My.SSS account. They can log in on their online account. Go to the inquiry tab and click on contributions to view their contributions in the WISP as well as their contributions in the regular social security program and WISP plus. – Press release  "

59,SSS releases record-high P5.9 B pension loans in 2022,"APRIL 9, 2023","  Social Security System President and Chief Executive Officer Rolando Macasaet said pension loan releases in 2022 reached P5.95 billion, the highest annual disbursement for the Pension Loan Program (PLP) since it started in 2018.
Macasaet said pension loan releases in 2022 almost doubled the P3.08B recorded in 2021, as from January to December 2022, the SSS has disbursed a monthly average of P495.77 million pension loans benefitting 10,660 retiree-pensioners, which is 93 percent higher than its corresponding monthly average in 2021 of P257.01 million to 5,753 retiree-pensioners.
“We are delighted we have assisted many of our retiree-pensioners for their short-term and immediate financial needs. We also prevent them from becoming victims of private lending institutions that charge high interest rates and require them to surrender their ATM cards as collateral,” Macasaet said.
Likewise, the number of PLP applicants grew after the national government eased up community quarantine restrictions in the country, which allowed retiree-pensioners to submit their pension loan applications in SSS branches.
“Our records show that a total of 127,920 retiree-pensioners availed of the PLP in 2022, which is 85 percent higher than the 69,036 retiree-pensioners who availed of the program in 2021,” Macasaet said.
Luzon recorded the highest number of PLP applicants with 30,158 retiree-pensioners amounting to nearly P1.39M in pension loans. The National Capital Region came in second with 28,239 borrowers amounting to P1.43M. Visayas follows with 17,038 loan applicants amounting to P740M, and Mindanao with 12,917 borrowers amounting to P590M.
Meanwhile, online application through My.SSS portal had 39,568 loan applicants amounting to P1.80B.
The SSS chief said 69 percent of the borrowers filed their loan applications through SSS branches while 31 percent used their My.SSS account in filing their PLP applications.
Macasaet said PLP applications through its online portal My.SSS also grew in 2022.
“Starting May 2022, SSS enhanced PLP by allowing first-time applicants to file their loan applications using their My.SSS account, resulting in 39,568 approved pension loan applications in 2022, a 963 percent increase from only 3,721 in 2021,” he added.
“Opening an online facility for PLP borrowers paved the way for more retiree-pensioners to access this loan program. It also offered them convenience because they could submit their application even in the comfort of their homes. Once approved, the loan proceeds are directly credited to their disbursement accounts within five working days.”
SSS launched the PLP to assist SSS retiree-pensioners in their immediate financial needs by offering a loan program with a low interest rate of 10 percent per annum.
Macasaet said PLP offers its borrowers flexible installment payment terms ranging from six six to 24 months. “We also ensure the pensioners will still have a net take-home pension of at least 47.25 percent of their monthly pensions.”
Qualified retiree-pensioners can avail themselves of a loan equivalent to three, six, nine, or 12 times their basic monthly pension plus the P1,000 additional benefit granted in 2017, but not exceeding P200,000. – Press release  "

61,Dad eyes 5% tax discount for businesses w/ creative spaces,"APRIL 9, 2023","  Councilor Leandro Yangot Jr. has proposed an ordinance seeking to grant a five percent tax discount to all business establishments in the city with creative spaces.
Under the proposed ordinance, establishments with creative spaces must be accredited by the city administrator to be able to avail of the discount.
A creative space, according to the proposed ordinance, is an area or a place where artists can display and store their artworks and educate people about culture and arts. It serves as a venue for creative activities.
Yangot said private entities with creative spaces serve as added tourist attractions that “showcase the wonderful culture and creativity of the people of Baguio.”
“It is but appropriate that these establishments with creative spaces be granted business tax incentives as a way of showing the city’s appreciation for their significant role in promoting the creativity and culture of Baguio City and the Cordillera Region,” Yangot stated.
He added the city has been declared by the Unesco as a creative city and the first city in the country to be vested with such distinct honor of being part of the Unesco Creative Cities Network whose advocacy centers on fostering the power of creative for economic resiliency and sustainable.
“It is therefore best to have duly-identified and recognized areas in the city particularly in the six growth nodes where city artists can display, market, and store their wonderful masterpieces,” Yangot added.
The six growth nodes mentioned are the southbound hub in Dontogan which is a transport-oriented development and urban agriculture node; northbound hub in Irisan which is another transport-oriented development and arts and crafts node; the Cordillera gateway hub in Sto. Niño; the parks hub which is an interconnected network among all the parks in the city; and the eco hub in Kennon Road which is focused on ecotourism and urban agriculture; and the airport hub in Loakan Proper which is envisioned as a transport oriented and business incubator zone.
The proposed ordinance has been referred to the city council’s committee on appropriations and finance cluster B (taxes, fees, and other charges) for review. – Jordan G. Habbiling  "

PEZA Director General Tereso O. Panga and his team have met with IBPAP President and Chief Executive Officer Jack Madrid and some of the IBPAP officials on March 27 to discuss areas for active collaboration and strategic alliance for the creation of plans on effective investment attraction and facilitation in line with the goals of PEZA, the industry, and the government. 
Aside from the concerns of the IT-BPO industry with infrastructure and the implementation of the work-from-home, Madrid highlighted their issue on talent. 
“We have a severe talent demand-supply gap which we need to address. Surely, we are a country with rich pool of talent and the result of that is many people want to continue to invest in the Philippines. But increasingly, the challenge is not the cost, it’s the people,” Madrid said. 
“We now live in a world where being able to work remotely is important. It’s also the reason of people who are over-concentrated in the Philippines. They are also beginning to diversify outside. But for many IBPAP members, we’re still their main handler, but the main message here is the mismatch and the supply and demand of talent,” he added. 
Panga said PEZA is cooperating with the ongoing initiative of USAID to prepare the Filipino workforce for the Industry 4.0. 
As of 2022, there are a total of 1,582 IT-BPM industry activities registered in PEZA which generated a total of P337.593 billion investments and 1,095,622 direct jobs. 
In 2022 alone, the IT-BPO sector has contributed about $17.005B of exports. 
For the first quarter of 2023, PEZA has approved six projects from the IT sector which is expected to bring P105.546 million investments, $8.932M exports, and 624 direct jobs. 
Through this collaboration, PEZA and IBPAP remain bullish to achieve both of its 10 percent target for the year and contribute to the overall growth and development of the industry and the country in general. 
Madrid is also eyeing more IT park developers and IT locator companies to expand operations in the provinces which constitute 40 percent of current total IT investments nationwide, and with Metro Manila still registering an annual uptake of 500,000 square meters of office spaces. 
Panga added, “As our strategy, we will venture into new IT investment opportunities and follow through the leads from Pres. Ferdinand Marcos Jr.’s state and working visits to other countries to promote Philippines as the smart destination in the region.” – Press release  "
63,"SEC grants amnesty on late filing, non-filing of reports","APRIL 9, 2023","  The Securities and Exchange Commission had granted an amnesty on the late and non-filing of certain reportorial requirements to corporations and other regulated entities.
The SEC on March 15 issued Memorandum Circular 2 s. 2023, or the Grant of Amnesty for Non-filing and Late Filing of General Information Sheet (GIS) and Annual Financial Statement (AFS), and Non-Compliance with Memorandum Circular 28 s. 2020 (Requirement for Corporations, Partnerships, Associations, and Individuals to Create and/or Designate E-mail Account Address and Cellphone Number for Transactions with the Commission).
The amnesty is part of the SEC’s efforts to encourage regulated entities to comply with reportorial requirements under Republic Act 11232 or the Revised Corporation Code.
The submission of reportorial requirements will also allow for the identification of active and inactive corporations, and will allow the SEC to enhance and organize its database towards nurturing a healthy and vibrant corporate sector.
Under the guidelines, the SEC will provide an amnesty on the un-assessed and/or already assessed but not yet paid fines and penalties for the non-filing and late filing of GIS for the latest and prior years, as well as the non-filing and late filing of AFS, including its attachments such as the certificate of existence of program/activity and non-stock, non-profit organization forms for the latest and prior years.
An all-encompassing fine of P5,000 will be charged for all such violations, in lieu of the usual fines and penalties imposed by the SEC. The rates will apply provided that the corporation or entity will submit the latest reportorial requirement due at the time of the application, and comply with MC 28.
The P10,000 penalty for non-compliance with MC 28 will be waived.
Meanwhile, suspended and revoked corporations, including those which have filed for the lifting of suspension or revocation, will be given a 50 percent reduction on their assessed fines, encompassing all violations on the non-filing and late filing of GIS and AFS.
The amnesty will be extended to corporations, including branch offices, representative offices, regional headquarters, and regional operating headquarters of foreign corporations and foundations. It shall also cover associations, partnerships, and persons under the jurisdiction and supervision of the SEC that failed to comply with MC 28.
Only those which have filed an amnesty application and settled their fees on or before April 30 shall be eligible for the amnesty. The existing scale of fines and penalties shall thereafter be observed. – Press release  "
64,Public invited to free courses,"APRIL 9, 2023","  To achieve the localities’ vision of becoming smart urban areas, their residents must be tech-savvy.
This is why the Department of Information and Communications Technology is encouraging the public to avail of the free training courses offered by the agency.
Jennifer Mejia-Dizon, DICT Luzon Cluster 1 human resources management officer, said the agency is bent on enhancing the public’s technological knowledge not only to promote ICT in the delivery of government service, but also to support localities’ desire of becoming smart areas.
In Baguio, Dizon said the DICT supports the city government’s aim of becoming a smart city, but the reluctance, especially of individuals who are not tech-savvy, is a challenge.
“We support the smart city initiatives, but the challenge is we do not have smart people. Sometimes, people do not want to (engage) in simple GCash transactions,” she said.
Smart cities aim to integrate ICT in their operations and in the delivery of services, including connecting to their citizens. Smart cities are also defined by how much they maximize technology in analyzing, planning, and governing based on the specific data they collect with the use of electronic devices.
The DICT is offering free courses to enhance public knowledge and ability to integrate ICT in their daily lives.
Dizon said they recently graduated a group of senior citizens in the city who enrolled in their free ICT training.
Those who want to be updated on the trend, including women who want to pursue careers in ICT may enroll in the free courses offered by the DICT.
Among its other functions, the DICT is mandated to assist, guide, and support ICT-related activities and initiatives for countryside economic development.
It is also tasked to promote and assist LGUs and local stakeholders in developing specialized ICT-enabled investments areas by providing technical and industry-calibrated assistance in the use of ICT for the enhancement of key public services, development and promotion of local arts and culture, tourism, digital literacy, and talent development. – Jane B.

67,PHA says advances in science can help treat heart failure,"APRIL 9, 2023","  Heart failure or the condition where the heart is unable to pump blood properly can be treated with the advances in medications and diagnostics, a health expert said Wednesday.
In an online discussion, Philippine Heart Association (PHA) Communications Committee co-chair Dr. Luigi Pierre Segundo described heart failure as a cardiovascular disease (CVD), a silent killer among Filipinos, and its victims are getting younger.
The Department of Health earlier noted CVDs remain to be the leading cause of mortality nationwide, accounting for a third of the total deaths in 2021.
About 36 percent of Filipinos aged 20 years old and above are obese and 20 percent are smokers.
Moreover, about 50 percent to 53 percent of those between 20 and 59 years old are binge drinkers, and 40 percent are physically inactive.
Segundo said heart failure could be caused by heavy alcohol or drug use, high blood pressure, heart rhythm disorders, valve problems, heart attack, congenital heart problems, and sleep apnea.
Cardiologist Rochelle Regina Cruz said its symptoms include breathlessness, tiredness, edema or swelling, and palpitation.
“Our heart can no longer pump enough blood with oxygen to supply the different organs. The blood, which must flow in an outward direction, goes back to the source, the lungs, resulting in water in the lungs, hence the breathlessness and swelling,” Cruz said.
Heart failure, including its type and severity, could be detected through 2D echocardiogram or heart ultrasound.
Once diagnosed, patients with heart failure may undergo cardiac rehabilitation for treatment.
In this treatment, patients perform physical exercises under the supervision of nurses, physical therapists, and doctors who monitor their blood pressure, heart, and symptoms.
“It is proven that patients live longer. They are not admitted in hospitals. Breathlessness and other symptoms are reduced,” Cruz said.
She added the treatment helps with depression as patients could socialize with other patients during the sessions.
Because not all hospitals nationwide have facilities offering cardiac rehabilitation, the PHA, through the National Heart Failure Network, established an initiative providing access or connections to specialists, hospitals, and institutions with facilities and technology for treating heart failure patients.
“These are PHA-accredited training institutions. Currently, there are 21 in the country. We, heart specialists, are guided by our mentors who are cardiologists),” Segundo said.
These institutions include the Angeles University Foundation Medical Center, Asian Hospital and Medical Center, Capitol Medical Center, Cardinal Santos Medical Center, Chinese General Hospital, Chong Hua Hospital, De La Salle Medical Center, Makati Medical Center, Manila Doctors Hospital, ManilaMed-Manila Medical Center, Mary Mediatrix Medical Hospital, Perpetual Help Medical Center Las Piñas, Perpetual Succour Hospital, Philippine General Hospital, Philippine Heart Center, Southern Philippines Medical Center, St. Luke’s Medical Center Bonifacio Global City, St. Luke’s Medical Center Quezon City, The Medical City, University of Perpetual Help Dalta Medical Center, University of Santo Tomas Hospital, and Vicente Sotto Memorial Medical Center. – PNA  "

“Hindi biro ang heat stroke dahil maaari itong magdulot ng permanent damage sa utak at iba pang vital organs tulad ng puso at kidneys, kaya iwasan po sana nating magbababad sa init,” PhilHealth acting president and chief executive officer Emmanuel Ledesma Jr. said in a release on April 2.
He advised the public to avoid drinking hot beverages like coffee and tea when the weather is too hot.
“Ugaliin din nating uminom ng tubig para hindi tayo ma-dehydrate,” he added.
According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, heat stroke is the most serious heat-related illness and can cause permanent disability or death if the person does not receive emergency treatment.
Heat stroke occurs when core body temperature rises to 41 degrees Celsius or higher and the body is unable to cool down.
Symptoms may include confusion, altered mental status and slurred speech; loss of consciousness; hot, dry skin or profuse sweating; seizures; and very high body temperature.
“Those with the highest risk for heat stroke are the elderly, the very young, and people with chronic diseases. Dalhin agad sa ospital ang sinumang nagpapakita ng sintomas ng heat stroke,” Ledesma said.
Ledesma reminded the public the state insurer covers confinement for heat stroke, sunstroke and heat exhaustion at P6,500, including P4,550 for hospital fees, and P1,950 for professional fees.
“Bilang paunang lunas ay maaari tayong mag-apply ng basang bimpo o tuwalya sa ulo, leeg, kili-kili at singit. Kung maaari ay bigyan din ng cold water o ice bath ang pasyente upang mapababa ang kanyang body temperature,” he said. – PNA  "

71,Bloodletting drive in Kalinga successful due to binnadang,"APRIL 9, 2023","  CITY OF TABUK, Kalinga – The Kalinga binnadang cultural practice is still alive among iKalingas of this generation with the increasing number of volunteers for humanitarian causes.
The provincial government under Gov. James Edduba’s Lumin-awa development agenda has embraced in all its partnership programs with other government sectors and private groups the spirit of volunteerism which contributed in the successful conduct of outreach activities.
Municipal and city local government units have also joined the bandwagon with binnadang becoming the strategy to achieve goals in local governance and in mustering public support to government programs and projects.
The system also becomes a pillar in promoting unity and cooperation among iKalingas and now a trend in efforts of bringing closer government services to the communities. Binnadang at its height was exemplified in relief operations during the pandemic and rescue operations during disasters.
The practice is also observed through bloodletting activities carried out through convergence by LGU blood councils, civil society organizations, uniformed men and women, corporate entities, individual donors for hospital patients in need of blood, and during special day celebrations by philanthropists.
In Batong-buhay, Balatoc in Pasil and in Rizal last month, volunteer donors flocked to separate venues during bloodletting activities organized by respective local government units in partnership with the Cagayan Valley Medical Center.
Thirty units of blood were collected in Balatoc while 171 units were collected in Rizal during the activity facilitated by LGU and CVMC health personnel and supported by the communities. – Peter Balocnit  "
72,PH’s put-up of own CDC in preparation for pandemics,"APRIL 9, 2023","  The creation of the Philippine Center for Disease Prevention and Control (CDC) is a preparation for future pandemics and threats to public health and not “medical martial law”, Department of Health officer in charge Maria Rosario Vergeire said.
“Nowhere can you find within this CDC draft bill any provision that will state that we are going to have a medical martial law,” Vergeire said in a media forum. “In fact, this bill will be an attached agency of the Department of Health.”
Over social media, some individuals expressed concern about the CDC “controlling” the health of the Filipino public once it is created.
The Covid-19 pandemic, Vergeire said, bared the weaknesses of the nation’s healthcare systems which are expected to respond in times of healthcare crisis.
The bill would be vital in the generation of science-based evidence for diseases and addressing the lack in epidemiology services and surveillance system.
It would harmonize laboratories, health experts, and scientists for speedy trials to determine needed technologies in addressing certain illnesses, among others.
The CDC bill is one of the priority measures of the Marcos administration.
The House of Representatives has approved on third and final reading the CDC bill in December last year. The Senate version has yet to be approved. – PNA  "

In a media forum, DOH officer-in-charge Maria Rosario Vergeire said sun burn or redness of the skin after staying under the sun for a few hours is common and not alarming but warned against prolonged exposure to UV radiation.
“Pero ‘yung nag-stay kayo the whole day under the sun, tapos nakita niyo po ‘yung balat niyo hindi na lang po namumula, pumuputok putok na, nagtutubig, kelangan na po ninyo magpatingin sa doctor para mabigyan kayo ng necessary medication o treatment,” she said.
Citing data from the Philippine Dermatological Society, Vergeire noted there are around 2,700 Filipinos who have had skin cancers since 2011.
“From 2011 to 2021, we had a total of 2,102 basal cell carcinomas and 614 squamous cell carcinomas,” she said.
Severe sun burn and skin cancer could be prevented.
“Ang paglabas po sa araw, iwasan po natin, lalong lalo na kapag matindi ang sikat ng araw, and always wear sun protection ‘yung ating mga nilalagay na mga sunscreens para mapo-protektahan din tayo from the direct effect of sun to our skin,” she added. – PNA  "

75,Laws for decarbonization boost ASEAN value chains,"APRIL 9, 2023","  Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) economies need to implement policies promoting decarbonization to strengthen its global value chains’ (GVCs) long-term competitiveness and resilience as they go “green”, according to a report released by the Asian Development Bank (ADB).
“This involves a careful balancing act – maximizing potential benefits of ASEAN GVCs and RVCs (regional value chains) while minimizing the risks and costs of decarbonization,” said the report “ASEAN and Global Value Chains: Locking in Resilience and Sustainability.”
The report said policies that help offset the costs – reducing the impact of other components in trade costs – include adopting climate-smart non-tariff measures and low or zero tariffs on climate-smart goods and accelerating trade digitalization.
It also cited adopting climate-smart trade and transport infrastructure; and preparing for carbon pricing, including carbon border tax adjustments (CBTAs).
Border tax adjustments address carbon leakage which occurs when high-emission production moves to countries with less-stringent carbon policies, it said.
“These (CBTAs) also address producers’ concerns over losing competitiveness if domestic carbon pricing is higher than those of overseas competitors. The proposed European Union Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism is the most advanced CBTA and is set to be in effect in 2024,” it added.
Aside from decarbonizing GVCs, the ADB report said resilience also means securing the resource base through human skills development and making available technology more inclusive.
It said human skills development requires comprehensive labor market policies and institutions supported by strong social dialogue between governments and organizations representing employers and workers.
“It is critical to have a strategy that can help transform these relationships, using employment and social protection policies that reduce gender inequality, make the labor market more inclusive, and invest across a broad range of skills development – to allow workers to move into higher value-added jobs within the value chain. Deep trade agreements with labor provisions can help strengthen the link between increased GVC participation and decent work,” it added. – Press release  "

Senator Sherwin Gatchalian said all options must be weighed, especially large rivers where IPs may be residing.
“Dapat timbangin natin. Ang mga IP at ang environment, kailangang maging balanced tayo para hindi sila malagay sa alanganin ,” Gatchalian said.
He said lack of water supply will also affect energy resources, considering that 10 percent of power supply in the country comes from hydropower plants.
Gatchalian previously told the Energy Regulatory Commission to impose penalties and file charges against electricity distributors that “over-contract” power supply to the detriment of consumers who pay for them.
Over-contracting is the practice of power distributors, including electric cooperatives, of purchasing more than the consumers’ electricity demand during a certain period.
Allaying fears of power outage, Gatchalian said he was assured by the National Grid Corporation of the Philippines that it has enough reserve energy during the hot dry season. – PNA  "
81,Firm shares predictions on trends in bathroom designs,"APRIL 9, 2023","  Trend forecaster WGSN report has cited seasonal forecast trends that can be applied to bathroom categories which will inspire interior design and commercial product ranges this autumn/winter (A/W) 24/25 season.
In a webinar, client specialist Anchi Wong said these trends are dynamic living, surprising color and dual realities.
“Homes of the future will need to become more flexible and bathrooms have become a key area of investment for consumers who are looking to get the most out of their living environments,” she said.
Wong said the A/W 24/25 forecast Inter-Actions inspires designs that make bathroom spaces more accommodating and adaptable, which will be paramount as consumers demand more functionality from their living spaces.
She said surprising color is another key trend which is more about aesthetics.
“Bold, high-octane color amps up bathroom spaces with unexpected placements and atypical palette combinations that animate functional designs,” she added.
Under dual realities, Wong said the A/W 24/25 forecast trend Expanded Imagination inspires digital metaverse aesthetics to update minimalist bathroom designs with a futuristic take on industrial styles.
“Layered transparencies and strategic daylighting inspire bathroom environments that play with perception, while products that offer multiple uses come to the fore with cool reflective shine,” she said.
With these trends, brands are advised to prioritize wellbeing, tap into the appeal of natural materials, be bold with color and pattern, and invest in functional and adaptable design details.
Wong said they need to address consumers’ preference to create a restorative space for self-care by offering products that showcase rounded forms that are hard to resist and feel-good textures that create a sense of comfort.
“Use dimensional weaves for bath linens, rugs and shower curtains, and tap into the allure of curves for items like drawer-pulls and faucets. Address consumers of all abilities in product ranges, with inclusive designs that embrace an independent lifestyle,” she said.
Wong said marbled stone, travertine, and sandstone are key materials that can elevate both residential and commercial bathroom spaces.
“Contrast hard materials with ultra-soft textiles that have subtle surface dimension, including waffle textures and textural grids. Explore the contrast between rough and smooth surfaces to build intriguing tactility on countertops and sinks. Include wood, which is a key material for adding an element of warmth to bathroom spaces,” she said.
Wong added color and pattern have the ability to refresh perennial ranges and give them a new point of view.
As consumers spend more time in their homes, Wong said bathrooms need to perform just as much as other rooms. – Press release  "

89,Bogus bookings and tour packages noted,"APRIL 9, 2023","  The scam involving bogus tourism offers is not an exclusive concern of Baguio City, but also in other areas frequented by visitors.
The Department of Tourism-Cordillera shared the call of the Baguio City Tourism Office for tourists to be wary of engaging the services of entities offering cheap accommodation, tours, and transport services online due to the proliferation of individuals involved in bogus booking services for tourists.
DOT-CAR Senior Tourism Officer Bayani Malicdem said concerns about fake booking services are also reported in other tourist spots in the region like Sagada, Mountain Province and Banaue, Ifugao.
The DOT has been intensifying the campaign for the public to patronize DOT-accredited establishments, tour operators, and tour guides to avoid being victimized by individuals offering deals of packages that are cheap, but are not existing.
Tourists are advised to contact the DOT and secure a list of accredited accommodation facilities and other tourism-related services like transport services and tours or if they want to be sure that the entity they are dealing with online is legitimate.
“Tourists dealing with DOT-accredited accommodation facilities and tour guide services are assured of quality and standards and are safe from scams,” Malicdem said.
The BCTO has also been reminding tourists to check first if the entity they are dealing with is listed in the Baguio Visita.
City Tourism Officer Alec Mapalo said the office has been receiving numerous complaints about bogus booking.
“What’s unfortunate is, most of the complaints are against entities that might not even be from Baguio City because they were transacted online and aimed at visitors who want to have a good deal,” Mapalo said.
He added tourists only realize they were scammed when they arrive in the city and their booked accommodation and tours do not exist and the people or the entity they transacted with online can no longer be contacted.
Tourists who fall prey to scammers are given options on where to rebook.
Baguio City Police Office Director Francisco Bulwayan, Jr. said if a tour package offered online is too good to be true, then it probably is a scam.
The BCPO created anti-cyber crime teams to help clients who complain of unfair online business transactions such as bogus bookings. – Jane B. Cadalig  "

In its Facebook account, the LTFRB-Cordillera has encouraged transport service entities and individual operators to secure a copy of Memorandum Circular 2023-017 to be attached to their provisional authority. To recall, the LTFRB earlier issued MC 2023-017 that extended the deadline for consolidation to Dec. 31 without the need for jeepney operators to file for extension. MC 2023-017 revoked MC 2023-013, which gave public utility vehicles until June 30 to join existing consolidated entities to continue their operations, the LTFRB acknowledged the need to review the implementation of the PUV Modernization Program. “Due to the recent pronouncements of President Ferdinand Marcos, Jr. and Transportation Sec. Jaime Bautista on the need to review the PUV Modernization Program and to assess the level of compliance by the stakeholders, the Board deems it proper to recall MC 2023-13 pending such review and while consultations are being undertaken,” the LTFRB circular stated. The PUV Modernization Program has mandated the phasing out of dilapidated jeepney units and replacing them with safer and more environment-friendly vehicles. It required jeepney operators to consolidate their units into larger fleets with at least 15 vehicles that will be operated by accredited cooperatives or corporations, which will be granted franchises by the LTFRB. The program also mandates the use of Euro-4 compliant engines, which are more fuel-efficient and emit less pollution, aside from being equipped with safety features such as GPS tracking devices and closed-circuit television cameras and dashboard cameras. Jeepney operators have threatened to stage a week-long strike in March to protest the phaseout of traditional jeepneys and to convince the government to defer the implementation of the PUVMP. The government launched the PUVMP in 2017, which sought to replace the traditional jeepneys with modern units. – Jane B. Cadalig  "

93,"BIR reminds businessmen on senior citizen, PWD discounts","APRIL 9, 2023","  The Bureau of Internal Revenue reminded establishments in Baguio City of the mandated 20 percent discounts to senior citizens and persons with disability recently. 
During a seminar on March 29 organized by the BIR Revenue District Office 8, at least 235 senior citizens and business owners were guided on how to compute the 20 percent discount to seniors and PWDs. 
Although the activity focused on business owners, senior citizens were also reoriented on their rights and privileges as consumers. 
Revenue Officer III Raymond Beding of the RDO-08 Assessment Section reminded senior citizens and PWDs are entitled to 20 percent/value added tax exemption when purchasing medicines and availing of medical and dental services including diagnostic and laboratory fees; transport fare including when doing advanced booking.
Jenny P. Chomping Revenue Officer II on the other hand reiterated to business establishments to remove the VAT before computing the discount. 
“They forget to remove the VAT and when that happens theres a higher chance of billing or there will be a larger total amount the senior citizen will be paying,” she said. 
Chomping said goods such as cigarettes are not covered by the 20 percent discount to promote health and well-being.

94,Lang-ay Festival resumes with a bang,"APRIL 9, 2023","  After a three-year hiatus, the sound of gongs and revelry filled the capital town of Bontoc in Mountain Province as officials and residents celebrated the 16th Lang-ay Festival grand street dance and the 56th founding anniversary of the province on April 5.
The street dancing mixed category and the street dancing children’s category, and street chanting mixed category and cultural showdown with competitors from the 10 municipalities of Mountain Province drew thousands of spectators from the province and other parts of the country. The participants who represented their respective towns showcased their graceful dancing to the beat of the gongs, exhibiting the different ethnic dances in the province such as the takik or the courtship and community dances.
The children’s street dancing category made it all the more interesting as the kids displayed their prowess in the cultural dance and beating the gongs and solibaos (conical tenor drum) just like the adults in the community. 
Also, the mixed chant category reintroduced the community to the age-old chants, some usually performed during planting season and special events in the community, while others performed more lively and creative chants about the Lang-ay celebration. Usec. Joseph Sagandoy, Deputy Presidential Legal Counsel, who served as the guest of honor during the celebration, urged the people to preserve the good cultural values of the province.
Sagandoy, who grew up in Bontoc, said that culture is also evolving as it adapts through the changing times, adding there were cultural practices before that are not practical to conduct in the present times.
“But there are many aspects of our culture that have endured over time because they are inherently good or beneficial to the individual and the community in general. These are the values, beliefs and practices that have survived and have now become parts of our identity as Igorots from Mountain Province,” Sagandoy said. He cited the values of Mountain Province such as being a peace loving people, a people who values hard work,  the og-ogfo or bayanihan, the strict observance of the inayan and the protection of the indigenous practices such as the music, dances and cultural attires which is being passed on from one generation to another.  
“Our culture forms part of our identity as a people, as such we need to preserve it as much as we can,” Sagandoy said.      
Also, the people of the province have a culture of resilience such as what is observed during the pandemic when the community was able to survive on their own. He said with the upholding of these cultural values, it could  act as a guidepost to the future of Mountain Province. 
This year’s celebration is with the theme: “Strengthening communal capabilities for cultural protection and appreciating cultural richness as instruments for more resilient and peaceful communities.”
Police Regional Office-Cordillera Director B/Gen. David Peredo, Jr., who hails from Sagada, also graced the event which gathered people from all walks of life during the celebration. – Ofelia C. Empian  "
95,More booths needed as SIM registration deadline nears,"APRIL 9, 2023","  A lawmaker called on the National Telecommunications Commission (NTC) and public telecommunications entities (PTEs) to set up more registration booths or assistance desks in a last ditch joint effort to make Filipinos register over 100 million SIM (subscriber identity module) cards before the April 26 deadline. Camarines Sur Rep. Luis Raymund Villafuerte said the government and the PTEs have to go full-blast on their registration drives after Holy Week, as he cited the latest survey results by the Social Weather Stations that 55 percent of Filipinos knew just recently that the sign-up was mandatory. “It’s possible that many SIM card owners have not signed up yet because even if they know that the sign-up is a deterrent to crime, they are probably clueless that the registration is mandatory, or that they would no longer be able to use their unregistered SIM cards because the government would deactivate them by April 27,” Villafuerte said. Citing data from the NTC website as April 2, he said a total of 57.19 million SIM cards have been registered with the three PTEs, which is just 34 percent of an estimated 168.977 million SIMs nationwide. He said owners of deactivated SIMs would no longer be able to make and receive calls or access their SIMs’ data services and online connectivity, preventing them from accessing websites or using applications that require an internet connection. He added owners of deactivated SIMs could no longer access their one-time password, which is a security feature in banking and media applications and other online platforms. Villafuerte said the NTC and PTEs have to get the support of local government units, particularly those in far-flung communities with weak internet connection, to put up registration booths. “One way to accelerate the registration process this last registration month is for local executives to help the PTEs, Department of Information and Communications Technology, NTC, and other concerned sectors establish more off-site centers where people can sign up, especially in places with limited Internet or telecommunication access,” Villafuerte said. He said local executives could play a more active part in ensuring the success of the SIM registration process in the same way that local governments have had a lead role in the Covid-19 vaccination rollout in their respective localities. He said the DICT could also extend the four-month registration period by another 120 days or four months, if necessary. “Otherwise, the government will have to extend the four-month deadline if it wants to record in the system as many numbers possible from the total SIM cards in the country whose owners have yet to register ,” he said. – PNA  "
96,Senator pushes for enforcement of laws for disabled learners,"APRIL 9, 2023","  All local government units must establish at least one Inclusive Learning Resource Center (ILRC) in their cities and municipalities, as stated under Republic Act 11650 or Instituting a Policy of Inclusion and Services for Learners with Disabilities in Support of Inclusive Education Act.
Senator Sherwin Gatchalian reminded ILRCs are mandated to implement inclusive education programs and deliver free support services to learners with disabilities.
He noted the absence of the implementing rules and regulations more than a year since it was passed, thus delaying provision of minimum services and conditions in schools, including assistive devices, facilities and infrastructure during the admission process, and other forms of reasonable accommodation.
According to the 2022 Country Report on Human Rights Practices in the Philippines by the United States Department of State, RA 11650 is not effectively enforced and many barriers remain, including architectural barriers that make attendance difficult for persons with disability.
To ensure the progressive realization of the objectives of RA 11650, the crafting of a multiyear roadmap is required to guide government agencies and private stakeholders.
The roadmap should contain the current policy, practices, gaps, and challenges affecting the early and basic education of learners with disabilities
Detailed targets and outcomes will cover a minimum period of five years.
Gatchalian said under the 2023 national budget, P160 million was allotted under the Department of Education’s capital outlay to allow each region to convert at least one special education center into a model ILRC.
“This will steadily expand access to inclusive education programs,” Gatchalian said in a statement.
Vice President and Education Sec. Sara Duterte said in her Basic Education Report 2023 in January that lack of infrastructure and facilities remains a problem.
“The lack of school infrastructure and resources to support the ideal teaching process is the most pressing issue pounding the Philippine basic education. The Department is not blind to the reality that there is a need to build, repair, and maintain school infrastructures to accommodate the growing number of learners all over the Philippines,” she added.  – PNA  "

98,Private sector needed in disaster risk financing,"APRIL 9, 2023","  The Philippines is looking at more ways to improve its financial resilience to disasters, including enhancing the involvement of the private sector in disaster risk financing (DRF), National Treasurer Rosalia de Leon said. “Engaging our private sector to be more involved in disaster risk finance helps to minimize the burden on the national government, diversify and spread the risk and deepen the insurance sector market,” she said in a recent webinar on advancing the financial resilience agenda. Citing the 2015 AIR risk model, de Leon said average annual loss due to typhoons and earthquakes has reached P177 billion or over $3.2 billion, which is nearly one percent of the country’s gross domestic product. “Disasters arising from natural hazards have resulted in a large fiscal impact in our economic system,” she said. “The large impact on disasters in my country makes it imperative for us to be more proactive managers of our risk.” De Leon said the country likewise is looking to make risk transfer programs more accessible to stakeholders. “Constant dialogues with local and international partners, the regulators and development partners are being done to develop and implement more accessible risk transfer mechanisms for both public and private sector,” she added. – Press release  "

100,"Digital tech to cut on trade costs, pushed","APRIL 9, 2023","  Countries can implement a menu of policy options to reduce trade costs, including digital technologies, and boost exports, according to a report of the World Bank. “The fading momentum of global trade growth is diminishing its role as an engine of output and productivity growth. Countries therefore need to find new ways to reap the benefits from trade. One possibility is to cut trade costs to boost exports and encourage imports in a manner that is growth-enhancing,” it said in a report, Falling Long-Term Growth Prospects: Trends, Expectations, and Policies. WB said digital technologies may eventually lower trade costs behind the border, at the border, and between borders, including by improving transparency and price discovery as well as information flows between exporters, shippers, and country authorities. “This may particularly support global supply chains,” it said. Citing earlier reports, the WB said robotics can help accelerate port procedures while artificial intelligence can help lower logistics costs by optimizing route planning, storage, and inventory, as well as by improving tracking and monitoring. The report said 3D printing can help shorten and localize supply chains, thus reducing the environmental footprint of trade; blockchain technology can help reduce time spent in customs, especially for time-sensitive goods, facilitate cross-border payments by increasing transparency and credibility, and enhance information sharing within supply chains. Such technologies may disproportionately benefit small and medium-sized enterprises that currently face higher trade costs than large enterprises, it added. The report said comprehensive packages of reforms have often been successful in reducing trade costs. Such packages can include trade facilitation measures; bilateral and multilateral agreements aimed at deeper trade integration; and coordinated efforts to streamline trade procedures and processes at and behind the border, it said. The WB also cited improved domestic infrastructure; increased competition in shipping and logistics; reduced corruption; simplified trade-related procedures and regulations; and the harmonization or mutual recognition of standards. – Press release  "

Yes, there’s one at the Bureau of Jail Management and Penology-Ifugao District Jail (IDJ) at Tiger Hill in Banguigue, Kiangan. The IDJ child-friendly visitor’s area is the first of its kind in the Cordillera. BJMP-Cordillera Director Jail Chief Superintendent Revelina Sindol, IDJ Chief Inspector Gannisi Olosan, Gov. Jerry Dalipog, Vice Gov. Glenn Prudenciano, and First Ifugao Provincial Mobile Force Company Acting Force Commander Police Lt/Col. Cesar Mallong led the inauguration of the visitor’s area on March 21.  Rev. Father Felix Bay-ong blessed the facility. The area is a separate section of the jail located in front of the IDJ building. It has child-friendly amenities such as toys, games, and art supplies to help children feel comfortable and entertained during their visit. The walls were also decorated with bright colors, murals, and other child-friendly designs to create a warm and inviting atmosphere. Funds for the construction came from a raffle-for-a-cause conducted by the IDJ in December 2022. With the new facility, the IDJ can provide an appealing and nurturing space for children who will visit their parents. The BJMP is mandated to provide humane safekeeping and development of PDLs in all jails nationwide, and to maintain ties with their families, PDLs are allowed to receive visitors. Prisons though convey negative impressions among children visiting their incarcerated parent or guardian. To address such concern, the BJMP issued Memorandum Circular 115 for the establishment of the visitor’s area that is conducive to children and visitors. Sindol lauded the IDJ for establishing a conducive visitor’s area and thanked the provincial and local government units, partner agencies, and the participants for supporting the raffle-for-a cause.  “We hope this child-friendly area will serve as a model for other jail facilities nationwide and for its warden to take similar initiatives. Together, we can create a safer and more inclusive community for all as BJMP ensures the humane safekeeping of all persons deprived of liberty,” Sindol said.  Dalipog also congratulated the IDJ led by Warden Olosan for initiating projects not only for the good of the inmates but for their loved ones as well. – Florida Robles  "

104,"Art exhibit , Burnham lighting mark city’s World Autism Day","APRIL 9, 2023","  In the continuing effort to showcase the talent of people with autism, the Autism Society of the Philippines, Autism Hearts Foundation in coordination with the Fashion Arts Autism Benefit (FAAB), and the Persons with Disability Affairs Office mounted on April 3 two separate events celebrating the 2023 World Autism Awareness Day.
One event is the launching of an art exhibit by members of the FAAB at the Manor and wearing of blue and lighting of blue-colored lights at the Burnham Lake.
Blue is associated with calmness and acceptance is the designated color for people on the autism spectrum. The color was popularized by Autism Speaks, an autism awareness organization based in the United States.
In speeches delivered by Mayor Benjamin Magalong, he said people with autism could live with dignity and need not be a burden to anyone if they are fully accepted and given support so they will have a chance to thrive in society.
“They have a right to live with dignity…they have to be given the right intervention and support so they can live a fulfilling life and contribute immensely to society,” the mayor said during the opening of the art exhibit at The Manor.
People who have been supporting the causes for people with autism also said that if more people allow those with special needs to flourish in the areas where they excel, they become productive members of the society and less dependent on their guardians or parents.
Camp John Hay Leisure Management Inc. General Manager Ramon Cabrera said it was only recently when he personally witnessed that despite their condition, people with autism can excel if they are provided with the avenue within which to showcase their intellect, talent, and skills.
In November last year, a mural made by people with autism was unveiled at the Manor as part of the hotel’s Enchanted Holiday’s event.
Cabrera said the mural, done by a small group and mentored by volunteer artists and teachers of SPED Baguio, was finished in only four weeks – proof that with proper guidance, they can accomplish something worthwhile.
“They have dreams. They want to be someone in the community someday. Those who are verbal are able to express their aspirations. And those who are non-verbal have become the voices of their groupmates who cannot speak. They want to be seen, they want to be heard. And I think they deserve to be,” Cabrera said and assured that The Manor, the Camp John Hay Golf Club, and the Camp John hay Development Corporation will continue to support people with autism.
CHJDevCo Chief Executive Officer Robert John Sobrepeña and his wife, Lissa, are supporters and organizers of the FAAB for the benefit of people with autism.
Cabrera said more people can be helped if the community, not just a small group, will help.
“There are many autistic individuals out there. We can only do so much. We need your help so that these autistic individuals get to as far as where they want to be. Because they can. We just need to believe they can,” Cabrera said.
The Manor Resident Manager Christine Cua added acceptance begins with changing our perception of “curing” or “converting” autistic people and instead focus our time, energy, and resources on accepting, supporting, and including autistic people and advocating for their rights.
“This way, we help enable our autistic people to claim their dignity and self-esteem, avoid being made fun of, and to become fully integrated as valued members of the community,” Cua said.
She said we in the “normal spectrum” need to discover and tap their strengths, provide opportunities to use these strengths, and make them more visible by including them in community events so that they and their families and us can meet halfway to make a better place for everyone.
Cua said the levels of acceptance and awareness about autism vary but said their common cause is they are aware that their condition should not be used as an entitlement, and hence should be given space to prove that they can be somebody.
“Let us give their parents that there is a kinder world when the time comes that they have to leave their autistic children behind. They are not asking for the moon. All they ask for is to be accepted, to be included. Let us give them a chance,” Cua said.
Councilor Art Allad-iw, chair of the committee on employment, livelihood, cooperatives and persons with disability, who also attended the exhibit launching at The Manor, thanked the groups advocating and supporting the causes of people with autism.
He said Baguio already has policies in place to safeguard and support people with disability, but he admits that more needs to be done for the sector.
“We need to realize the motto – No one should be left behind,” Allad-iw said, vowing to continue advancing the needs of PWDs through more legislations.
As support, Councilor Leandro Yangot Jr. donated easels and acrylic paints, while the Camp John Hay Golf Club donated P150,000 to the FAAB for its continuing project of training artistically-inclined people with autism. – Rimaliza A. Opiña  "

This as the country marked the start of the commemoration of the Philippine Veterans Week (PVW) which runs until April 12. In a statement, DND chief Carlito Galvez Jr. said he is profoundly grateful to the veteran leaders and support institutions, partner organizations, as well as the youth sector for their participation in honoring the memory of the Filipino patriots. “Napakahalaga ng sama-sama nating pagbabalik-tanaw sa mga naiambag ng ating mga beterano sa ating natatanging kasaysayan, kasalukuyan at kinabukasan,” he said. Galvez said one of the DND’s legislative priorities is the bill seeking to create the Philippine Veterans Authority by integrating the functions of agencies mandated to serve veterans such as Philippine Veterans’ Affairs Office, the Philippine Veterans Assistance Commission, and the Board of Trustees of the Veterans of World War II. He added the DND is pushing for the enactment of House Bill 2490 or “An Act Rationalizing the Disability Pension of Veterans,” which aims to uplift the lives of disabled veterans, who incurred military service-connected disability, sickness and injury. Under the measure, disability pension rates would be increased to P4,500 for the lowest disability rating and up to P10,000 for the highest disability rating. This would translate to a 488 percent increase from the current disability pensions rates ranging from P1,000 to P1,700 under Republic Act 6948 which was enacted in 1990. Guided by President Ferdinand Marcos Jr.’s vision of a stronger and better Philippines through economic recovery, national unity and nation-building, Galvez assured the stakeholders that the government will always side with the welfare and livelihood of the men and women in uniform. “Be assured that the One Defense Team always puts importance on the well-being of our veterans, soldiers, and civilian human resource,” the DND chief said. This year’s PVW carries the theme, “Kagitingan ng mga beterano, pundasyon ng nagkakaisang Pilipino” and calls for unity and solidarity as Filipinos are reminded of the value of working together and sharing in the burdens of the people. – PNA  "

108,"Harmonization of policies in DepEd, CHED, TESDA pushed","APRIL 9, 2023","  Senator Sherwin Gatchalian has filed a measure seeking to strengthen the country’s educational system through the creation of the National Education Council (Nedco) that will promote a culture of long-term, strategic and collaborative planning among the three education sub-sectors. In a press statement, Gatchalian said Senate Bill 2017 or the National Education Council Act, shall create the Nedco to institutionalize a system of national coordination, planning, monitoring, evaluation and management among the Department of Education, the Commission on Higher Education, and the Technical Education and Skills Development Authority. In pushing for the measure, the chairperson of the Senate Committee on Basic Education said the tri-focalization of the country’s education system in 1994 – CHED to handle higher education; Tesda to handle technical and vocational education; and DepEd to focus on basic education – was intended for the agencies to focus on their basic mandates to deliver and produce the outcomes expected of them. “While tri-focalization led to greater focus and depth in sub-sectors’ planning and implementation of development programs, the Presidential Commission on Educational Reform (PCER) created in 1998 flagged how it resulted in possible overlaps, gaps, inconsistencies in and non-alignment of policies, plans, and programs,” Gatchalian said. He said through the proposed Nedco, the country will strengthen the coordination among different government agencies to uplift the quality of education. SB 2017 seeks the formulation of a national education agenda, which shall be anchored on national development plans. It shall establish, among others, the country’s strategic vision for education, long-term and medium-term goals, strategies for a coordinated and coherent implementation, and recommendations on the corresponding investments and appropriations. The Nedco’s powers and functions will include the implementation of an action agenda for the development of the country’s capacity for and success in education as measured by indices and measures such as the National Achievement Test, Program for International Student Assessment, Education Index, Education for All Development Index, and others it may deem appropriate in measuring growth and development of the education sector. The three sub-sectors, concerned government agencies and concerned stakeholders shall strictly comply with the national education agenda, and shall incorporate its pertinent policies in their respective programs. Under the proposed measure, the President of the Philippines will be the chairperson of Nedco while the DepEd Secretary, CHED chairperson, and Tesda director-general will serve as co-chairpersons. Other members of the council will be the Senate President, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, and selected members of the Cabinet. The bill further provides the national education agenda shall have a minimum five-year horizon, to be updated annually and reviewed periodically by the Nedco. – PNA  "

Nograles said the agency’s month-long series of activities, which was highlighted by the “Piknik sa Kalikasan” on March 31, reinforced their collective commitment in strengthening the full participation of women in all levels, especially in decision-making and leadership posts. “We should take pride in this unique culminating activity as this reflects decades of gender advocacy efforts of the CSC and the leading role that the Commission plays in promoting gender equality in the entire bureaucracy, be it in the aspect of policymaking, technical assistance, or the implementation of our various programs and projects,” he said. Nograles said CSC’s gender and development mainstreaming efforts have led to the establishment of programs and policies in support of landmark laws for the protection of women in the workplace. This includes the promulgation of the disciplinary rules on sexual harassment cases that is considered as a landmark issuance of the CSC. The issuance provides consistent and uniform rules and procedures on investigation, prosecution, and resolution of sexual harassment cases in the government. The policy is also aimed at providing a safe and inclusive workplace for civil servants. The CSC also marked a number of milestones for the provision of work-life balance through the adoption of flexible working hours and expansion of leave privileges for both men and women, he said. “Along with being a gender-responsive human resources institution, our goal is to ensure equal opportunities for all,” Nograles said. Meanwhile, CSC Assistant Commissioner Victoria Esber gave an overview of the Prime HRM, or Program to Institutionalize Meritocracy and Excellence in Human Resource Management, where she emphasized the need to use a gender lens in the core HRM areas of recruitment, selection and placement, rewards and recognition, performance management, and learning and development.

In a statement, NTF-Elcac secretariat executive director Undersecretary Ernesto Torres Jr. said the rebels’ continued use of the weapon is a wanton violation of the International Humanitarian Law (IHL). He added the CHR’s unequivocal rebuke of the NPA is most welcome, especially since the IEDs were detonated near schools which caused trauma to learners. “We are in solidarity with the CHR in condemning the NPA’s vicious acts and violation of the IHL. The NPA’s use of IEDs in zones of peace, such as schools, exhibit their moral depravity and blatant disregard for the lives of the Filipino people, particularly the Filipino youth and students,” Torres said. In an April 3 statement, the CHR scored the NPA for launching attacks and detonating IEDs near schools that are “peace zones” and must be free from threats of harm. “This violent act goes directly against the very principles of the IHL. We further note that according to news reports, the IED was detonated near a public elementary school in Barangay Locso-on, leaving two soldiers and a minor injured,” it added. The CHR added the United Nations Human Rights Council had previously observed that “the continued use by NPA of mines and IED that kill and maim civilians in wanton violation of IHL is unacceptable.” In the recent clash between government forces and communist terrorists in Placer, Masbate, the NPA placed several IEDs near a public school, indiscriminately targeting soldiers and civilians. “No ideology can justify the endangerment of the right to life, liberty, and security of the Filipino people. We have always called for the end of armed conflict and the grave consequences it imposes upon those involved and those affected. Time and again, we have witnessed the harrowing impacts and violations to the fundamental human rights and dignity these encounters bring to society,” the CHR added. Torres assured the public the NTF-Elcac is in accordance with the CHR’s call for a just and peaceful resolution of the armed conflict and denunciation of all forms of violence and terroristic acts that endanger the lives of the Filipino people. – PNA  "
111,Market fire damage pegged at P40 million,"APRIL 9, 2023","  The five-hour fire that gutted Blocks 3 and 4 of the city public market last March 11 caused a total of P39.8 million worth of damage, according to the City Disaster and Risk Reduction Management Office.
CDRRMO Officer-in-Charge Antonette Anaban said the latest estimated damage to public and private properties was a result of the post-disaster assessment conducted by the local government.
She said the estimated damage cost to the structures including depreciation cost was set at P27M, the burned vehicle of the Public Order and Safety Division – P1.49M, damaged goods – P10.8M, damaged power lines – P72,000, and perimeter streetlights – P104,000 or a total P39.8M.
On the foregone losses that included the lost income of vendors and the revenue of the local government, Anaban said the same was estimated to be around P6.150M broken down into: P5.1M lost income of vendors computed at the daily rate of P400 multiplied by the number of affected vendors and P1.050M in terms of arrival fees collected by the local government.
Anaban said the city government also incurred unexpected expenses, particularly on the relocation of vendors amounting to P8M and logistical expenses amounting to P375,000 or a total of P8.375M.
In terms of food packs, the local government received around P3.556M from donors, particularly P2.091M worth of food packs from Sen. Sherwin Gatchalian; P700,000 worth of canned goods from Sen. Christopher Lawrence Go; P520,000 worth of rice packs from Sen. Robinhood Padilla; and P245,000 worth of rice bags from Vice President Sara Duterte.

112,"Stone Kingdom now open, with conditions","APRIL 9, 2023","  The management of the reopened Stone Kingdom, which became a hit destination in Baguio City, is expected to come up with innovations to minimize crowd and address traffic congestion along Longlong Road at Pinsao Pilot.
Baguio City Tourism Officer Alec Mapalo said the reopening of Stone Kingdom, whose operations was halted in November last year, is subject to conditions, which the management must comply with for it to be issued a permit.
Mapalo said the reopening of the facility is covered by a provisional permit and management must comply with the conditions, among which is the traffic mitigation plan to address congestion along the road that serves as an alternate route for motorists coming from Baguio to La Trinidad and vice versa. The provisional permit is good for 90 days.
He said the traffic mitigation plan must be consulted and verified with the Baguio City Police Office, Traffic Division of the City Engineering Office, and the Department of Public Works and Highways.
Mapalo said the management has also presented a plan on how to manage the number of people entering the area.
“There is a plan of coming up with an online booking system to allow real-time monitoring of people and cars entering the area,” he said.
The city government has ordered the closure of Stone Kingdom for permit violations and safety concerns, but the City Prosecutor’s Office has dismissed the case filed against the theme park’s management, saying the latter has complied with the requisites of acquiring business permits.
Mapalo said the incident surrounding Stone Kingdom encouraged innovations that can be adopted by the city government in terms of business permit issuance and ensuring sustainability of tourist attractions.
He added the Stone Kingdom closure highlighted the need of ensuring the sustainability of tourist areas.
“With the experience we had with Stone Kingdom, the City Planning, Development, and Sustainability Office will make it a requirement for business permits applicants to validate their zoning and if an area has a potential or has been declared a tourist site, they need to consult with our office in terms of sustainability practices, including parking, to help their business become sustainable,” Mapalo said. – Jane B.

113,BSP says digital payment is secured,"APRIL 9, 2023","  The Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas has urged the public to embrace the shift in the way they transact business brought about by the government’s push for the broader adoption of digital payment schemes.
BSP officials said with proper knowledge and vigilance, the digital payment system is safe, more convenient, and a more efficient way of transacting business, whether one is buying goods or availing of services or is engaged in an enterprise.
BSP Payments Policy and Development Department Bank Officer V Maureen Franco said digital payment is safe as long as one is mindful and vigilant of the scams perpetuated by unscrupulous individuals.
“Let us not be afraid of digital payment because it is safe. We just have to be mindful and vigilant of the scams and protect our accounts the way we protect our physical wallet to avoid falling victims to fraud,” Franco said.
She encouraged those who have reservations on digital payment to create their accounts and start sending small amounts to their family members or friends for them to appreciate its benefits.
BSP North Luzon Director Noel Malimban said the agency is advocating the adoption of digital payment because it has become the norm of the current times.
Malimban said BSP’s digital payment initiatives are not devoid of challenges, but he assured the BSP continues to conduct financial literacy and teach the public on the safe use of digital payment.   
“Digital payment is the present. It is more convenient and faster. We have to learn how to use it the safe way. Let us not be left behind,” Malimban said.
Franco said the BSP is advocating the use of digital payments in line with the government’s desire to transform the country into a cash lite economy.
“Doing so will generate economic gains through cost savings from the handling, processing, and transportation of cash and checks. A typical medium to large business drawing 1,000 checks per month to suppliers could save them 25 percent to 46 percent of invoice handling cost, depending on whether half or more of these payments are shifted to digital,” she said.
From their savings, Franco added businesses will have extra funds which they can put into more productive use like buying more supplies or expand their business.
Digital payment also encourages increase in economic activity because of the faster time suppliers will receive money, compared to check payments where they have to wait for days for the checks to be cleared.
Franco added the improved transparency in digital payments can also help curb fraud and other corrupt practices because the money received and sent for every transaction is recorded and easily monitored.
Among the digital payment facilities are PesoNet, a batch electronic fund transfer, which is intended for planned and non-urgent transactions and alternative for checks. It is however, not available on weekends and holidays.
The transactions for PesoNet include government payment and collections, supplier payments, payroll, and loan dividend payouts.
EGovPay is another digital payment facility that allows individuals and businesses to pay taxes, fees, permits, and other obligations to the government through Landbank’s LinkBiz portal.
InstaPay is a real-time low value fund transfer, which is available 24/7.
A fund transfer intended for immediate transactions and is an alternative for cash. It can be used for domestic remittance transfer, e-commerce, bills payment, and other low value payments.
Another digital payment platform is QR Ph enables Filipinos to transfer funds by simply scanning a QR code through mobile phones.
BillsPay Ph meanwhile allows consumers to settle their bills even if they don’t have an account with the payment service provider of their billers.
To avoid being victimized by scammers, BSP Regional Economic Affairs staff Marian Patosa reiterated BSP’s check, protect, and report principle.
She said the public must be wary of text messages and emails that are urgent and come with links.
Patosa also advised the public to not give their personal information when people call or text them and ask for their personal information.
“Legitimate financial institutions do not ask you to give your names and number and one-time password (OTP) if they are the ones calling you,” she said.
While the government is pushing for a broader adoption of digital payment, the public must understand that ensuring safe online financial transactions is a shared responsibility. – Jane B. Cadalig  "
114,DOT gives tips on responsible travel,"APRIL 9, 2023","  Respect, connect, explore.
The Department of Tourism-Cordillera has offered tips on how tourists can become responsible travellers while visiting the region’s tourist destinations.
In a handout posted in its Facebook account, the DOT-Cordillera reminded tourists to respect the communities they are visiting by knowing their customs, beliefs, history, and culture. It also advised visitors to keep an open mind, be tolerant, and respect diversity.
Tourists are also reminded to connect with the locals. “In every place we go to, people live. The mutual connection can benefit you and you would learn things you would not expect,” the DOT stated.
The DOT also reminded visitors to be nice to the people, as not everyone is out there to take advantage of them. “Not everyone is trying to rip you off, so be nice and people will be nice to you too.”
To support local economy, the DOT has encouraged visitors to support local businesses by patronizing locally produced food and souvenirs and availing of tours from local tour organizers and guides rather those organized by multinational organizations.
Whenever possible, tourists may also give back and support local non-profit volunteers. “Usually, local organizations have a better understanding of what the community needs. Contact them for guidance.”
When taking photographs, the DOT reminded tourists to be ethical. “Engage with the person before taking a photo. Smile, talk, buy something, or ask nicely.”
Be an explorer. Instead of travelling to places struggling with over-tourism, the DOT also reminded tourists to go to lesser-known places, which often offer equally wonderful sights waiting to be explored.
To save and be spared from crowded destinations, tourists are advised to travel to famous destinations off-season where they can avoid the crowd, enjoy lower prices, and help the environment deal with the amount of tourists.
Tourists can also practice slow travel, which can be a challenge for those who have limited time and short days off work, but want to see a lot. The DOT however reminds: Sometimes it’s worth it to slow down, appreciate the place, and connect with the locals.”
Several municipalities are expecting an influx of tourists in line with their upcoming festivals and other tourism-related activities. – Jane B. Cadalig  "

124,Aoki wants Folayang as rival in future bout,"APRIL 2, 2023","   Japanese world-class grappler Shinya Aoki will celebrate his 20th anniversary as a professional mixed martial artist later this year. The 39-year-old Japanese legend has seen and done it all in the sport, possessing a long list of accolades that included two celebrated reigns as ONE lightweight world champion. He has also faced the best fighters in his prime, sharing the stage with the likes of Eddie Alvarez, Gilbert Melendez, Joachim Hansen, Caol Uno, Tatsuya Kawajiri, Kotetsu Boku, Kazushi Sakuraba, and Ben Askren. But over the 50 opponents he fought in his illustrious career, Aoki puts former ONE lightweight world champion Eduard Folayang on a higher pedestal. “Definitely, he is number one on my list,” Aoki said of the Filipino MMA superstar. “I spent five years fighting him. For me, Eduard is special because he’s the only guy I have fought three times,” he said. They first crossed paths in November 2016 when Folayang shocked the world by stopping Aoki in the third round to capture the world title. Aoki got his revenge on Folayang nearly three years later, reclaiming the gold by rendering the Filipino unconscious with a tight arm-triangle choke in the first round. The Japanese broke the deadlock in April 2021, submitting Folayang with a first-round armbar. Although he is up 2-1 in their trilogy, it seems that Aoki wants one more dance with Folayang. But unlike their first three bouts that took place in Japan and Singapore, Aoki wishes to do the fourth installment in the Philippines. Folayang said he will not turn down the chance to tie the series with Aoki. The rivals reconnected in January when Aoki visited Folayang in Baguio City. Given the close relationship that Aoki and Folayang developed, many speculated that the latter will join the former at Evolve MMA in Singapore. Last March 10, Folayang announced his departure from Team Lakay, ending his nearly two-decade relationship with the stable that he helped build. Folayang addressed the rumors about him going to Evolve MMA. “Right now, I’m a ronin. I’m thankful that I get a lot of invitations from friends in the industry. It’s flattering, to be honest. Everyone wants to help out and understand the goal that I want to achieve,” he said. “But at the moment, I’m training with different groups. That’s the exciting part because it gives me the chance to get well acquainted with other styles.” Folayang said it will be a privilege if he gets invited to train at the Singapore-based Evolve MMA. – ONE release  "

The DOST has provided P9.6 million worth of equipment for the packaging line and capability-building activities for the BCC stakeholders while the provincial government allotted P6.2M for the building renovations to house the project.
The joint project is under the DOST’s Smart Food Value Chain Program for the New Normal which aims to upgrade the capability of existing distribution centers/trading posts in the delivery of fresh and semi-processed agricultural products through the application of appropriate packaging technology and delivery system.
Diclas reported every peak season, Benguet produces over a million kilos of vegetables but post-harvest losses remain a problem for highland farmers.
DOST Sec. Renato U. Solidum Jr., in his virtual message, said “losses can be significantly reduced with an appropriate packaging system and post-harvest technologies.”
With this upgraded facility, Benguet farmers can now produce packed fresh, semi-processed, and ready-to-eat highland vegetables.
Buendia hopes the project will be in full operation towards the middle of the year generating additional income for the Benguet farmers and decreasing post-harvest losses by at least 20 percent.
“This project supports the modernization of the Benguet vegetable industry by providing upgraded multi-cold chain services,” said Briones.
DOST Usec. for Regional Operations Sancho Mabborang said the project demonstrates the agency’s support to smart farming by focusing to leverage advanced technology along the value chain.
Bantog encouraged the farmers and stakeholders to patronize and maximize the facility.
“Be ambassadors to the farmers by informing them the benefits of this facility and how it impacts on their vegetable produce,” she added.
Elizabeth Joy Punasen of Reaping Farm Fresh Corporation and one of the BCC stakeholders expressed her gratitude to DOST for identifying Benguet farmers as beneficiaries of the project.

129,DTI-BPS orders destruction of substandard circuit breakers,"APRIL 2, 2023","  The Department of Trade and Industry through the Bureau of Philippine Standards has prevented the sale and distribution of almost 1,000 pieces of substandard imported circuit-breakers.
The substandard products were found non-conforming to the inverse time-delay operation requirement of Philippine National Standard (PNS) 1573-2:1997 (Low-voltage switchgear and controlgear – Part 2: Circuit breakers) during the conduct of independent product testing.
The inverse time-delay operation requirement measures the duration of how long before a circuit-breaker trips or cuts off the flow of electricity once subjected to overload conditions. This requirement reflects one of the main purposes of circuit-breakers, which is to interrupt the electric current to prevent circuits from overheating which could eventually lead to an electrical fire and ultimately, damage to life and property.
DTI-BPS witnessed the destruction of the substandard imported circuit breakers at the importer’s warehouse in Parañaque City on Feb. 23. The products were destroyed and were disposed accordingly.
Circuit breaker is one of the 111 products and systems currently covered under the BPS’ Mandatory Product Certification Schemes (www.bps.dti.gov.ph/product-certification/list-of-productsunder-mandatory-certification). The regulated products are classified into three major product groups, namely electrical and electronic products, mechanical/building and construction materials, and chemical and other consumer products and systems.
The DTI-BPS implements two mandatory product certification schemes: the Philippine Standard (PS) Quality and/or Safety Certification Mark Licensing Scheme and the Import Commodity Clearance (ICC) Certification Scheme. Products covered by the mandatory certification, whether locally manufactured or imported, are not allowed to be distributed in the Philippine market without the necessary PS or ICC marks.

Providing farmers’ children with the educational support they need will encourage them to pursue agriculture and other related courses,” Duterte said.
He said the youth should be made aware that agriculture courses do not just involve farming, but also cover degrees in Agricultural and Biosystems Engineering, Agribusiness Management, Agricultural Biotechnology, Agricultural Economics, and Fisheries Technology, among other studies.
The subsidies provided under HB 7572 are on top of the free tuition offered under Republic Act 10931 or the Universal Access to Quality Tertiary Education Act.
Under RA 10931, dependents of qualified indigent farmers who pass the admission requirements in SUCs and other local universities and colleges (LUCs) for agriculture and other related courses will be entitled to free tuition and other school fees, as well as other incentives and subsidies, such as living and transportation allowances.
A qualified indigent farmer is defined under the measure as individuals included in the registry of farmers of the Department of Agriculture, whose sole source of income is cultivating the land they own or lease, or who actually engage in crop production, livestock, and poultry farming.
They said the bill would complement ongoing government efforts to increase agricultural production and assistance to small farmers.
In coordination with the Commission on Higher Education, the DA is tasked under the bill to establish a scholarship program for tertiary agricultural education.
In pushing for House Bill 7572, the authors cited data from the Philippine Statistics Authority showing the continuous employment drop in the agriculture sector, comprising agriculture, forestry, fishing, and the aquaculture industries.
From 24.5 percent (9.7 million) in October 2020 and 24.6 percent (10.77 million in October 2021), the PSA said, the share to total employment of the agriculture sector declined to 22.5 percent (10.6 million) in October 2022.
The PSA also said in terms of skilled agricultural, forestry, and fishery workers, the numbers continued to drop from 14.2 percent (5.7 million) in October 2020 and 12.4 percent (5.4 million) in October 2021, to 11.8 percent (5.6 million) in October last year.
Diminishing farm size and declining incomes have prompted the shift out of agriculture, according to the Philippine Institute of Development Studies.
“Hence, apart from measures that ought to increase agricultural production and farmer assistance, there is a need to encourage the young generation to choose the country’s agricultural sector,” the authors of the bill state. “Apart from encouraging the youth to consider entering the (agriculture sector), the measure will also uplift and motivate agricultural research that is vital in the sector’s quest for development.” – PNA  "

The Global Compact Network Philippines Prosperity Pillar, in collaboration with the Aboitiz Group, SM Investments Corporation, and other private sector partners, has launched Biyaheng Digiskarte, a mentoring program for MSMEs to help them leverage the latest technology, digital platforms, and market trends to grow their businesses. — Contributed photo  Micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs) are the backbone of the Philippine economy, providing livelihood for millions and making the most significant impact on the overall welfare of the Filipino people. With the volatile business environment, supporting MSMEs to remain competitive and future-ready is crucial.
To address this, the Global Compact Network Philippines (GCNP) Prosperity Pillar, in collaboration with the Aboitiz Group, SM Investments Corporation, and other private sector partners, has launched Biyaheng Digiskarte, a mentoring program for MSMEs to help them leverage the latest technology, digital platforms, and market trends to grow their businesses.
The first webinar of Byaheng Digiskarte under the GCNP Prosperity Pillar, titled “TechUp MSMEs and Financing,” successfully launched on March 22. The kick-off was designed to introduce MSMEs to the importance of adapting to the modern business environment through technology and an entrepreneurial mindset, as well as exploring digitization platforms and financial services available to them.
The kick-off webinar was attended by micro and small farmer entrepreneurs.
“Biyaheng Digiskarte focuses on helping MSMEs prepare for the future by providing them with capacity building training, upscaling, upskilling, and providing financial and market access. We will link them to different networks to enhance and improve their way of life, and at the same time transform them to become sustainable, innovative entrepreneurs for the long term,” said GCNP Prosperity Pillar Lead and Aboitiz Equity Ventures (AEV) First Vice President and Chief Reputation and Sustainability Officer Ginggay Hontiveros.
The Prosperity Pillar is part of the GCNP Private Sector Champions initiative for MSME recovery and resilience following the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic. The focus areas of the initiative are divided into three work streams: people, prosperity, and planet. The Aboitiz Group leads the Prosperity Pillar, which is adopting the Group’s Biyaheng Digiskarte mentoring program’s best practices for MSME recovery and resilience.
For the webinar, speakers discussed “Paano Maging Madigiskarte.” This included Peddlr Chief Operating Officer (COO) Aiko Reyes, Cropital Founder and Chief Executive Officer Ruel Amparo, Union Bank of the Philippines (UnionBank) Customer Experience Group Senior Vice President for SMEs and Micropreneurs Jaypee Soliman, and SB Finance President and CEO Abbie Dans-Casanova.
The attendees also heard from SG Farmers Association President and Sahoy Farm owner Girlie Sahoy. An entrepreneur based in Balili, La Trinidad, Benguet, her agribusiness was adversely affected by the pandemic lockdowns, border restrictions, and market closures, causing financial difficulties for her business and her family.
Amidst the hardships, “Biyaheng Digiskarte” empowered Sahoy and her fellow to become successful online agripreneurs. Her story is a testament to the power of technology for MSMEs, and served as an inspiration for the “Biyaheng Digiskarte” mentees who are well on their way to achieving similar success.
This was followed by a question-and-answer session with the speakers and was moderated by GCNP Program Officer Edward Marcel Gacusana.
“Let us all act collectively to help MSMEs recover losses from this pandemic and be resilient over time. Through our strategic and collaborative synergies in a dynamic ecosystem, working together will allow us to create meaningful and impactful approaches to recovery and resiliency building for them,” Hontiveros said.
The Prosperity Pillar involves collaborative efforts between the Aboitiz Group and its co-lead SM Investments Corporation, along with fellow member companies Philippine Marketing Association, Nestlé Philippines, Unilever, Pilipinas Shell Petroleum Corporation, ADEC Innovations, Subic International Management Consultancy, Converge, and SGV.
Future webinars under the Prosperity Pillar will cover supply chain sustainability, business continuity management, and diversification and market access. These topics are crucial for MSMEs to build resilience and sustainability in their operations. – Press release  "
132,Boost in domestic travel eyed,"APRIL 2, 2023","  Two of the country’s biggest tourism groups joined forces for a business-to-business fair to boost domestic and inbound tourism.
From March 28 to 29, the Philippine Tour Operators Association (Philtoa) and the Hotel Sales and Marketing Association (HSMA) hosted 87 sellers and 105 buyers in the 2023 Travel Exchange in Pasay City.
The two-day event served as a platform for HSMA and Philtoa member hotels, resorts, theme parks, tour operators and agencies to create travel packages that cater to both Filipino and international travelers.
“Our membership is basically nationwide; be it a business hotel or a leisure resort, we have that in our portfolio. In Philtoa, they have all sorts of travel agents that cater to different markets, and I think it’s such an opportune time for this partnership because the global market is starting to breathe again,” HSMA president Loleth So said.
With several Philtoa members offering corporate travel packages, the fair particularly favors the hotels group as its members turn to the Meetings, Incentives, Conferences and Exhibitions (MICE) market as revenue driver.
HSMA chair and Bluewater Resorts vice president for sales and marketing Margie Munsayac said their property’s participation in the first Travel Exchange, organized by the Philtoa last year, already generated around P10 million in bookings.
“We’ve had linkages with tour operators that have government agencies in their account and so they gave us several government agencies for two of our properties. It sustained us for quite some time up to now,” Munsayac said in another interview.
Philtoa president Fe Abling-Yu said the event further benefits tour operators, especially those who have no access or linkages yet with hotels and resorts to put up travel packages that promote local destinations.
“We’ve closed a lot of bookings last year and that’s what we’re also expecting for this year’s event. The tour operators who are participating here are not just doing domestic travel, they are also doing inbound,” Yu said.
The partnership is a first for the two associations and an addition to HSMA’s annual activities towards tourism recovery.
The group, with about 130 members nationwide, is prominent for its flagship September Online Sale. – PNA  "

In the Cordillera, women occupying key positions in mining companies said the integration of technology in mining operations made jobs less physical, which allowed them to perform works that used to be assigned to men.
“The mining industry used to be dominated by men because of the physical demands of the job. With technology and innovation, work became less physical. This has given us the opportunity to work in mine operations,” said Engr. Lyza Dim Apioten, chief mine engineer of Itogon-Suyoc Resources, Inc. (ISRI).
Apioten said the software they use help their male counterparts visualize the mine plans they give them.

In a press conference following his and other ranking police and anti-narcotics officials’ inspection of the site where the contraband was seized, Abalos said authorities are looking at the angle that a syndicate might be planning to establish locations on where to ply their trade.
“This will be distributed sa iba’t ibang lugar at dahil sa nangyayaring ito, apektado ang buong bansa kung kaya’t ito ang focus ng pamahalaan. This is the war on drugs. Sanib-pwersa ang lahat,” Abalos added, citing intelligence reports.

The Bamboo Textile Ph of the Department of Science and Technology-Philippine Textile Research Institute (DOST-PTRI) and Asist signed a memorandum of agreement this month marking the beginning of their partnership towards the establishment of the first bamboo textile fiber innovation hub in the Cordillera.  
Signatories to the MOA are DOST-PTRI Officer-in-Charge Dr. Julius L. Leaño, Jr., Asist President Dr. Gregorio T. Turqueza Jr., and DOST-Cordillera represented by Engr. Ralf Sapi-il.
Under the MOA, the DOST-PTRI will provide bamboo fiber extraction machines as well as trainings and technical assistance to bamboo producing groups and Asist personnel. This will give bamboo producing towns the capability and gain to transform raw bamboo into bamboo textile fibers for a greater value.
During the presentation of the project, the DOST-PTRI discussed the relevant increase in value of bamboo fibers in Abra after being processed into finished bamboo fabrics. A single bamboo pole costs between P100 to P200 depending on the length while a five-meter finished bamboo fabric can cost between P2,000 to P3,000.
Turqueza underscored the possibilities of partnership among agencies in achieving their goal.
“Collaboration among agencies has always proven to be crucial in advancing their goals. This will contribute to the pursuit of technological innovation and advancements which will enable us to meet our needs in textile production,” he said.
Leaño thanked Asist for supporting the project.
“This will be the very first innovation hub in the Cordillera region and we want government to take that accountability in making sure that we deliver this technology. We are truly thankful for your support in this project,” Leaño said.

144,Vendors have qualms about vending areas,"APRIL 2, 2023","  Vendors affected by the March 11 fire that gutted Blocks 3 and 4 of the Baguio City public market raised various concerns on the state of their vending area.
The vendors, who sought an audience with the city council on March 26, raised concerns about the safety of the restored Block 4 structure.
They also want the size of their stalls to be maintained and for proper zoning of goods to be observed.
The Kayang-Hilltop Women Vendors’ Association represented by Sofia Villanueva said they are wary about the safety of the building where they returned days after selling in a temporary site.
Villanueva said their sales are adversely affected, citing claims that marketgoers have become wary of the safety of Block 4.
“We want to be assured that the building is safe because even the marketgoers are afraid to go inside due to concerns on their safety,” Villanueva said.
Councilor Mylen Yaranon, who earlier asked engineers to check the structural integrity of Blocks 3 and 4, said the Philippine Institute of Civil Engineers is still wrapping up its report.
Vice Mayor Faustino Olowan said the city would not have allowed the vendors to go back to their stalls if the area was not safe.
This was in response to Villanueva’s claim the vendors were forced to return to their stalls because the market superintendent said they will be cited for violations if they refuse. The violation they were supposed to be cited for was not clear to the vendors.
Aside from concerns on structural integrity, the vendors are asking that the original size of their stalls, which is one meter by 1.5 meters, be maintained.
Villanueva said their stalls have been reduced to one meter by 0.60 meters, which reduced the amount of goods they can display.
She said they did not have any idea on how their stalls would look like because they were not involved in the construction.
“We only saw the area after it was constructed. The current size of our stalls is not reasonable,” she said.
She added they also prefer the original zoning inside Block 4 where stalls selling fruits, highland vegetables, and lowland crops would be grouped in one area and not mixed up.
“Magulo po ang mga paninda dahil hindi na-observe ang zoning ng mga prutas at gulay,” Villanueva said.
While acknowledging the vendors’ concerns, which he said should have been raised with the market superintendent instead of the council, Olowan asked the vendors to also help in the city government’s efforts to weed out individuals who have multiple stalls in the market.
Olowan said the city councilors have been receiving complaints about recurrence of unfair practices inside the market.
The city government has been working to end the unfair practices at the public market, such as subleasing, selling of stalls, and people having multiple stalls. – Jane B. Cadalig  "
145,Mayor & BWD warn as water crisis looms,"APRIL 2, 2023","  Mayor Benjamin Magalong and Baguio Water District General Manager Salvador Royeca called on owners of private deepwells and water delivery businesses against over-pumping of water and doing abusive practices that harm the city’s water table.
The two officials made the call in a coordination meeting last March 27 to address the water crisis currently experienced in the city and its prognosis in the light that the summer season had barely started.
One concern discussed was the practice of some private deepwell owners to over-extract their water sources for profit.
“It is sad that there are people who think only of their business and what they can earn without any regard to what they are doing to the environment. Please be warned that over-pumping of water and other activities that harm the environment are against the law,” Magalong said.
The mayor and the BWD head will again meet with the National Water Resources Board (NWRB) to request for intensified regulation and monitoring of the operations of the registered water supply businesses.
They will also again ask the board to address the proliferation of illegal deepwells, which is one of the identified causes of the declining yield of the city’s water sources as these deplete the recharge areas of the city’s underground water sources resulting to the decline in pumping water levels.
In 2021, the city listed a total of 210 permitted water companies drawing from the city’s underground aquifers while the number of those that do not have permit was still not determined.
The mayor said the crisis is real based on the numerous complaints received at the city’s level. “And this is concerning, considering that we are just at the beginning of summer,” he said.
Royeca said BWD adopted measures like augmenting supply for the affected areas particularly the elevated ones by tapping existing sources with excess in yield and by streamlining water supply schedules to ensure continuous supply.
He said long-term solutions continue to be pursued like exploration works and drilling of more wells.
Both officials also urged the public to help conserve water in their homes, offices, and establishments with these tips:
Repurpose water and use every drop;
Recycle water by reusing laundry water for flushing toilets, cleaning bathroom or washing cars;
Turn off faucets when not in use, say when brushing your teeth;

146,Revisions in FPIC process sought,"APRIL 2, 2023","  Twenty-six years after the passage of the Indigenous Peoples Rights Act (IPRA), cause-oriented groups and individuals in the Cordillera think it is time to amend some provisions of the law specifically the free, prior, and informed consent process (FPIC).
In development projects mostly initiated by mega companies, members of indigenous cultural communities in Bokod, Benguet; Cabugao, Apayao; and Ifugao who shared their experiences said the FPIC has become a venue for bargaining between a proponent company and the community, instead of the former giving, without conditions, what the community wants.
In a forum last March 28, members of ICCs who attended a forum organized by Baguio-based law firms said proponent companies that earn billions give them a mere pittance in royalties.
Leopoldo Lamsis, an elder of the Shakilan ni Ikulos, an indigenous peoples organization in the ancestral domain of Bokod, said they asked SN Aboitiz Power-Benguet for higher royalty fees of nine centavos per kilowatt hour from the one-centavo per kilowatt hour that the company used to give them but this was reduced to only about three centavos per kilowatt hour. He said they issued a certificate of non-consent (CNC) but the company appealed.
Lamsis said a CNC should not be appealable for this undermines community consensus and the National Commission on Indigenous Peoples should not be an instrument in dealing with these appeals.
In the case of the proposed Guined Dam project in Apayao, community elder Ramos Bongai said there was disinformation about the project, which made some members of their community give their consent to the proposal.
In Ifugao, Tony Tanguid said proponent companies manipulate the FPIC by “importing” supposed community members and make them sign a certificate of consent.
Ibaloy lawyer and Baguio Councilor Jose Molintas said the experiences shared by the different ICCs are proof that changes should be done to strengthen the FPIC process.
Citing the San Roque, Ambuklao, and Binga dam projects, Molintas said the problem with the FPIC is that when ICCs give their consent to one project, other companies explore more areas to develop thereby exposing ancestral domains to development.
“The danger with the FPIC is if you allow one, they keep on coming back,” Molintas said.
He said before any form of development is introduced in ancestral domains, the NCIP should first help ICCs formulate their ancestral domains sustainable development and protection plan (ADSDPP) where the community will determine the kind of development they want in their domain.
Molintas said an ADSDPP gives ICCs control over how to manage natural resources within their ancestral domain at the same time allows development but limited to what was agreed by the community.
“Kung sino lang ang may gusto ng dam, sila lang ang dapat lapitan ng mga developers or companies. That way, we empower indigenous peoples,” Molintas said.
Lawyer James Solano, one of those representing indigenous peoples who filed complaints against officials of the NCIP and elected officials in Apayao concerning the Guined Dam project, said the FPIC process is flawed.
He said proponent companies should not be initiating an FPIC but the communities to be affected by proposed projects.
Molintas added, hiring or appointment of NCIP commissioners also has to be reviewed. He said there is no genuine representation when some of them become mouthpieces of government, instead of IPs.
“It was okay in the beginning because the commissioners truly represented the sentiment if IPs. Now they are influenced by programs of the government such as the Elcac (End Local Communist Armed Conflict),” Molintas said, referring to IPs being red-tagged for mere opposition to a developmental project.
“When we say ‘no’, they claim we are being influenced,” Molintas said, referring to IPs who have been labeled as involved with communism when they oppose projects that they feel will compromise their ancestral domain.
Molintas said the Office of the President should come up with a more democratic process in the appointment of commissioner. “We want better people from the community – from the grassroots,” the councilor said while alluding to a commissioner who allegedly did not want to use Igorot as collective term for IPs of the Cordillera because of their supposed links to communists.
He also called on the congressmen of the six provinces of the Cordillera and Baguio who are pushing for an autonomous region to first address payment of royalties to ICCs.
He said genuine autonomy should first recognize the sacrifices that IPs had to endure in order to achieve the growth experienced in the region now and that is through proper compensation for atrocities committed to their forefathers, centuries ago. – Rimaliza A. Opiña  "
147,1st motor vehicle inspection center to be built in LT,"APRIL 2, 2023","MOTOR VEHICLE INSPECTION CENTER IN LT — A fully computerized and automated private motor vehicle inspection center will soon be constructed in Puguis, La Trinidad, Benguet through the CPP Motor Vehicle Inspection Center which conducted its groundbreaking ceremony on March 30. The facility, which currently operates as a private emission testing center, is eyed to be completed within six months and will function as an inspection site by NCII accredited technicians, in compliance with exhaust emission and roadworthiness standards set by the Department of Transportation through the Land Transportation Office. The groundbreaking ceremony was witnessed by CPP owner and operators Casio Paris, Jr. and Oscar Paris and family, La Trinidad Councilor Teddy Walang and representatives from the DOTr-Cordillera and LTO-CAR, and blessed by Pastor Christopher Calyaen. — Ofelia C. Empian  The first private motor vehicle inspection center (PMVIC) will soon rise in La Trinidad, Benguet which is an upgraded version from the previous emission testing centers required by the Department of Transportation.
The CPP Motor Vehicle Inspection Center in Puguis, La Trinidad held its groundbreaking on March 30 and is expected to be constructed within six months.
Oscar Paris, one of the owners and operators of the family-run center, said the facility is a state-of-the-art motor vehicle inspection center, which is fully automated and computerized from the previous manually operated emission testing centers.     
Paris said the 1,500-square meter facility, which currently operates as a private emission testing center, will be expanded to cater to the required 300 vehicles to be serviced within a day.
The Private Motor Vehicle Inspection Center is a facility that conducts computerized and automated inspections of vehicles, as well as visual inspections by NCII accredited technicians, in compliance with exhaust emission and road worthiness standards set by the Department of Transportation through the Land Transportation Office.
While emission testing centers test only for exhaust emission compliance, the PMVICs will also conduct 72 other points of road worthiness compliance aside from the emissions. It will inspect private, government and for-hire light vehicles (4,500 kilograms and below), which include SUVs, pick-ups, sedans, hatchbacks, and motorcycles/tricycles.
Paris said the automated testing system will determine if the vehicle passed or failed. If the vehicle fails, it has to be brought to a certified motor vehicle shop outside of their scope. He said all the information in their system will be linked online with the LTO information system, thus the owners no longer need to personally appear in LTO. 
“The facility is more than just a business but a public service because we have to ensure that the vehicle is roadworthy. This is a big challenge for us MVICs to properly certify motorists and not just to collect fees so the effect would be lesser accidents and lesser road traffic,” Paris said.  
CPP stands for Casio Palberas Paris, Sr., the family’s patriarch who started the private emission testing center in the municipality back in 2003.
The groundbreaking ceremony was witnessed by CPP owner and operators Casio Paris, Jr. and Oscar Paris and family, La Trinidad Councilors Teddy Walang, John Botiwey, and Francis Lee and representatives from the DOTr-Cordillera and LTO-CAR, and blessed by Pastor Christopher Calyaen. – Ofelia C.

148,‘Water shortage is a form of a disaster’,"APRIL 2, 2023","  A water crisis in this highland region is a disaster waiting to happen.
City Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Officer III Louie Glenn Lardizabal said the water scarcity that has perennially been bugging Baguio City can become a disaster that will affect the residents’ overall well-being if no sustainable solutions are done to address it.
Saying water scarcity is also a DRRM concern, Lardizabal said there is a need for residents to adopt water conservation and preservation measures and for other stakeholders to look for ways by which water can flow back to nature.
Lardizabal said without serious water preservation efforts and interventions, the water scarcity will lead to other concerns, such as health problems.
“We are waiting for a disaster to happen if we do not practice conservation and implement water preservation measures,” he said.
Baguio, which is one of the areas in the country that receives the highest amount of rainfall, is also one of the areas that continue to struggle with water shortage.
The problem is compounded by the influx of visitors during peak season.
Lardizabal said with water crisis, people’s health can be compromised due to lack of safe drinking water.
“Without clean water, how can you prepare and serve clean food?” he added.
Lardizabal said nature-based solutions as adopted by other countries are also among the cheaper alternatives to arresting the water crisis.
Instead of paving waterways with concrete, Lardizabal said it is best to leave the base unpaved to allow water absorption.
In concrete jungles like Baguio, the reabsorption of water is less possible, which also makes it difficult for aquifers to recharge.
“There’s a need to implement policies like requiring building owners to integrate rainwater harvesting facilities in their structures,” he said.
At the household levels, the city government is encouraging residents to recycle water; shorten their shower time; and use tubs, basins, or pails when washing clothes.
Water crisis is defined as the lack of fresh water resources to meet the standard water demand.
The Baguio Water District reported it can meet the average daily demand of 42,087 cubic meters with its average daily supply capacity of 47,865 cubic meters.
The BWD has 46,000 service connections.
Globally, the Unesco reported two billion people do not have access to safe drinking water and 3.6 billion people lack access to safely managed sanitation. – Jane B. Cadalig  "
149,Tuba elders says no to hydro power project,"APRIL 2, 2023","  Elders and leaders of the Tuba ancestral domain passed a resolution rejecting the proposed three-megawatt hydroelectric power project of AQA Green Renewable Energy in Tuba, Benguet.
In the resolution of non-consent dated March 17, the indigenous cultural community elders and leaders stated they are opposed to the project for the safety and protection of the community lives and properties.
The resolution stated the situation of the river and its edges is unpredictable while the community is prone to flooding and that the project’s siltation will have a negative effect along the river bank.
Other justifications cited by the elders are the existing gold panning and other livelihood activities will be affected; it will affect the development of tourism along the Aran Cave; and it will disturb the cultural practices and the peace and order of the community. 
“This resolution of non-consent reflects the decision of all members of the Tuba ancestral domain and the decision came about after undergoing the free prior and informed consent (FPIC) process,” the elders stated.  
The resolution was signed by 51 elders and leaders and witnessed by members of the FPIC team coming from the Tuba ancestral domain and National Commission on Indigenous Peoples.
As of Sept. 30, 2022, the Department of Energy’s data of awarded hydropower projects showed there are six other hydroelectric power projects in Tuba.
These are the Abdao and Abdao 2 HEPP by AV Garcia Power Systems Corp. which is in its development stage; Irisan 3 and Irisan 1 HEPP by Hedcor, Inc. which is commercially operational; Tadiangan HEPP by Goldlink Global Energy Corp. which is in the pre-development stage, and the Kennon HEPP by J3S Hydro Power Corp. which is in the development stage.

Nursing students of Easter College Inc. recently turned a previous composting pit at Pinsao Pilot Project into a park they now call “Connecting Space.”
Joshua Medina, one of the students of Department of Nursing 2B, said after pondering on an activity that will be beneficial to the residents for their NSTP 2 subject, they came up with an idea that is beneficial to everyone.
“The area served as a compost pit site of Barangay Pinsao Pilot Project for a long period of time. As expected, piles of non-biodegradable wastes and plants were deeply planted under the soil. During the implementation, issues and problems arose hence making us rethink if our decision was right. However, with a little push and encouragement from the group and with the help of the barangay captain, the project still continued and thankfully, it was a success,” Medina said.
Connecting Space is now open to the public.
“It is a great place to hang out, promote connection between ages, genders and race to have a bond to provide a new rest area and green space to enjoy the view of the city as well as the sunrise and sunset,” Medina said.
Over at T. Alonzo, another group of 15 students also helped beautify the barangay park for their NSTP subject.
Student Aubrey Tuvera said part of their objective was to install solar-powered flower lights to cheer up the garden at night.
“It was not enough but we installed what our meager budget afforded. We also cleaned the garden. We wanted it to have a likeness with the Apayao park that became a tourist attraction because of those solar powered lights and the barangay allowed us to test our idea. We also planted natural flowers,” Tuvera said, adding they did the project in only two weeks. – Aileen P. Refuerzo  "

155,Revisiting the Slaughterhouse,"APRIL 2, 2023","Bulalo is a bowl full of boiled tender beef bones and cartilages.  In Baguio City, it is a must to visit the eateries at Slaughterhouse at Lower Magsaysay Avenue at least once a year for the unpretentious familiar flavors of table fare in these parts of the country.
The simplicity of the sauteed, grilled, or boiled foods with garlic, onions, and ginger spices are as they describe, comfort foods, no matter the risks of arthritis or gout.
Bulalo is an all-time favorite in this place because there is a guarantee the meat is tender as well as all the tendons and cartilages that attach them to the bones and joints. The soup is as rich and flavorful because of the length of time that the beef bones have been simmered. For now, the smokey flavor from former wood fueled stoves are gone and the clean gas fueled stoves have removed this bonus. Every Filipino has a taste for this simple food spiced with green onions when served. In the Visayas, this is boiled with lots of ginger for a spicy and scented soup.
Of course, pinapaitan, another favorite bitter flavored soup made from cow or goat innards, is also best served at Slaughterhouse. Another food that is patiently boiled to tenderize the tripe most of all, small intestines, the lungs, kidney, and a little liver, then the softened parts are sauteed in garlic, onions, and ginger. This is simmered and when tender and cooked, the bile is added for the bitter taste. The amount of bile depends on the preference of the eaters. In some parts of Ilocos, they like it more bitter and add more of the bile. Here at Slaughterhouse, they have tempered this to a light bitter flavor to the soup. They say that this is the best antidote to a hangover.
The inihaw na baboy and the blood sauce is another must. This has changed a lot and lacks the delicious, candied corners from the heat of charcoal and the smokey taste of burned pork fat flames that lick the sides of the meat. The clean crispy grilled meat that has tender meat on the inside, quite like the air fried meats, has replaced the former charcoal grilled ones. Of course, these are healthier options and environmentally friendlier ways of cooking, one misses the fire charred surfaces. But still delicious with the blood sauce mixed with chili peppers and some calamansi.
Chicharon bulaklak has been modified in many restaurants to improve the crispiness and flavor. This time, the crispiness of the pork intestines has been enhanced by a light coating with flour. It has tenderized the connective tissues too. This is dipped in spiced vinegar with onions and chili peppers. This is perfect with a cold bottle of beer in summer. Liver is a must with this combination of dishes. Fried liver in garlic and soy sauce and caramelized onions is a requirement to make this lunch perfect. The chewy strips of liver and its salty bitter charm is one of my occasional favorite meals. It is said that cravings come when the body needs the minerals in the food. I like to dwell on this for a moment while I indulge.
To carry the dangerous diet into good light, it is not so bad to indulge in this kind of fare once or twice a year. It is comforting to think that instead of the boring multi-vitamins that we take, making them savory from meats and meals is a nice spike.
Enjoy what you eat, but don’t kill your body.  "

161,Dads to probe disputed Irisan lot for OCSWD,"APRIL 2, 2023","  A city council committee was tasked to look into the validity of the agreement that transferred the possession of a lot in Barangay Irisan to the Office of the City Social Welfare and Development (OCSWD).
The council tasked the committee on laws to study the deed of donation that allowed the OCSWD to own a 5,000 square-meter of lot where the office has put up structures for the youth, the elders, and rebel returnees, among others.
The lot was donated in 2001 by the heirs of Felipe Pucay, through Elsie Kiwas-Pucay.
The heirs of Frumencio Salda sought the council’s intervention, saying as co-heirs, they were not consulted when Elsie Pucay signed the deed of donation.
The heirs of Salda are claiming more than 1,200 square meters of the lot donated to the OCSWD.
Pucay reportedly signed the deed of donation as the administrator and not as the sole heir of Pucay.
OCSWD representative Nestor Mestito, who also appeared before the council, said the claim of the Saldas has been decided by the court, which ruled in favor of the city.
He said the case for recovery of possession, which was filed by the late Frumencio Salda, was dismissed and the latter did not appeal the decision.
He said the decision noted the Saldas were not able to prove their prior possession of the land they are claiming.
The heirs of Salda however said they have been occupying the land for decades as it is where they derive their livelihood through farming.
The claimants are also asking the OCSWD to open the portion that the office enclosed to allow them passage and facilitate the transport of their agricultural produce.
Mestito said after the deed of donation, they installed a perimeter fence to secure the area, which accommodates children, among others.
Councilor Isabelo Cosalan, Jr. said there is a need to further study the validity of the deed of donation executed by Pucay since the other owners who have claims over the lot were not consulted.
The city council also requested OCSWD and the City Buildings and Architecture Office to reopen the road used by the claimants as passage route, pending the resolution of the dispute.
The city committee on laws, human rights, and justice chaired by Councilor Peter Fianza will inspect the area and conduct a public consultation among the parties concerned, including the National Commission on Indigenous Peoples. – Jane B. Cadalig with a report from Jordan Habbiling  "

169,BFP finds electrical issue as cause of Pilando fire,"APRIL 2, 2023","  Investigators of the Bureau of Fire Protection have identified electrical arcing as the main cause of the fire that transpired at the Pilando Center Building in Lower Magsaysay on March 26.
After an ocular at the battery room of the establishment’s solar system, Senior Fire Officer 3 Jose B. Dagson said electrical arcing happens when an energized electrical wire sticks to a conductor such as iron or electrical wire or when a circuit becomes overloaded and overheats.
For the structural fire at the Pilando building, Dagson said they saw an indication of an electrical surge which caused the ignition of fire.
Common electrical problems where arcing may occur include plugs that are loose in the outlet, outlets that do not work, lights that dim or flicker, tripping circuit breakers, hot or smoking outlets or switches and light bulbs that burn too often.
Dagson said further investigation will be conducted with physical evidence such as electrical wirings, a terminal of the battery, and welded part of the steel shelf from the battery to be sent to their headquarters for laboratory analysis.
Cost of damage was estimated at P5 million.
BFP Baguio Chief of Operations Insp. Bartolome Cacamo is grateful that the incident was reported immediately by building maintenance personnel Brenan Nahaman when he noticed dark smoke emanating from the battery room of the building around 6 p.m.
Tenants and shoppers were also promptly evacuated until fire out was declared at 6:40 p.m.

173,Dads urge speedy process for subdividing prvt lots,"APRIL 2, 2023","  Members of the Baguio City Council, during the regular session last March 27, called on the City Planning and Development Office (CPDO) to relax the process and requirements in subdividing titled residential lots.
The councilors stressed that the cumbersome process and excessive requirements place too much burden on applicants who simply want to partition their lots for residential purposes. 
Councilor Jose Molintas said the applicants are required by the CPDO to submit a development plan for the issuance of a development permit with total fees amounting to P1,500. All these requirements and fees when the applicants only intend to subdivide the lot into two, he said. 
Councilor Benny Bomogao said all the cumbersome procedures are in contravention with the Ease of Doing Business Act.
The councilors claimed the onerous process undertaken by the CPDO in subdividing residential lots can be traced to the office’s misinterpretation of Ordinance 63 s. 2016.
Asked about the legal basis for all these requirements, Elias Aoanan, CPDO representative, cited Section 22 of the ordinance which states that “…all owners and/or developers of subdivision projects shall, in addition to securing a locational clearance, be required to secure a development permit…”
The councilors said the CPDO should know the difference between “subdividing a simple residential lot” and “subdividing a lot for commercial purposes.” While the latter requires the issuance of a locational clearance and a development permit as prescribed in the ordinance, the former does not require such as it has no legal basis. 
Councilor Isabelo Cosalan Jr. said the concerned offices should fully understand the law in order to implement it based on its actual intent.  
Aoanan said they had already waived some of the requirements such as the submission of a topographic map. 
Meanwhile, representatives of the Department of Environment and Natural Resources said they only require the updated copy of the title, a geodetic engineer waiver, and a verification fee of not more than P25 for the approval of the subdivision of a titled lot into two which is not intended for commercial and selling purposes.
During the session, it was also made clear that the power to approve subdivision plans for residential, commercial, or industrial purposes and other development purposes is granted to the city council.
Under Section 447 of the Local Government Code, the Sangguniang Panlungsod shall “process and approve subdivision plans for residential, commercial, or industrial purposes and other development purposes.”
Also, Executive Order 71 states the local government unit shall approve the “subdivision schemes and development plans of all subdivisions, residential commercial, industrial and for other purposes of the public and private sectors” in accordance with the provisions of Presidential Decree 957, as amended.
This is one of the powers of the Housing and Land Use Regulatory Board devolved to the local government unit by virtue of EO 71.
Cosalan questioned the approval of the DENR for subdivision surveys/plans when the application did not pass through the preliminary approval of the council and the CPDO.
The DENR representatives explained that they have Presidential Decree 957 and Batasang Pambansa 220 as their legal bases in approving subdivision surveys/plans.
Cosalan said all these procedures in approving subdivision plans/surveys and simple subdivision undertaken both by the DENR and the city government should be “harmonized.”
The city council, through a resolution, urged the CPDO to convene the city’s subdivision monitoring team to create a flowchart detailing the procedures in approving subdivision plans. The flowchart should indicate that simple subdivision of residential lots should not pass through the process as required by Ordinance 63, s. 2016. – Jordan G. Habbiling  "

175,Task force focusing on mental health ordered,"APRIL 2, 2023","  Mayor Benjamin Magalong ordered the creation of a task force to implement mental health advocacies and strategic programs in hopes of addressing mental health issues that led to the increase of suicide cases in the city.
The task force will be led by the City Health Services Office with the guidance counselors of the Department of Education, mental health advocates, and the Baguio City Police Office.
It will serve as the implementing arm of the Baguio City Mental Health Council which is the policy-making body also led by the CHSO.
The mayor wanted a holistic and proactive approach in addressing mental health problems not only focused among teens but encompassing all ages and gender.
The mayor said he was no stranger to the mental health problem, having experienced the phase of guiding and protecting a family member who suffered from a depressive disorder.
“Malapit ang loob ko sa mental health issues kasi alam ko ang hirap at sakripisyo na kaakibat upang mapagwagian ang ganitong problema. We need to be patient and expand our understanding for our family members undergoing this illness. It’s the only way we can win,” Magalong said.
The mayor tasked the BCPO to help the CHSO in surveying the areas where suicide cases commonly occurred tracing back to 2017 using their Geographic Information System and the Crime Information Reporting and Analysis System.
“I want to understand the characteristics of these places so we can come up with better solutions. We might need to do structural redesigning of our facilities,” the mayor said.
Already rolling are capacity building activities to strengthen peer counseling programs especially for academe as well as information, education and communication campaigns to address mental health concerns, among others.

The operation is carried out to ensure that areas prone to disorder, crime, and problems caused by alcohol, rage, and other factors are monitored for the safety of the public. It is conducted daily from around six until midnight.
The operations include police doing searches of customers for possible weapons such as ice picks, knives, and even guns to prevent any untoward incidents that may cause harm to themselves and others.
“Operations like this truly help because it might be a tiring procedure to the police but it assures us that we are safe. When we go out with my friends we enjoy the night because we are not scared of what danger awaits us,” a customer of one of the establishments said.
A second-year female student taking Bachelor in Forensic Science added, “This should be mandatory because there are a lot of bars in Baguio and fights are prone in these establishments; mostly there are young people here.”
“ID should be properly checked at all establishments that offer alcoholic beverages making sure that customers are truly of age. There should always be proof of legality and birthdays should be easily seen. Bars that allow minors must be made accountable for their actions as there will be an increase of juvenile delinquency in Baguio,” she added.
The BCPO is encouraging the public to enjoy their evenings out with family and friends but reminding them to always drink moderately. – Joshua Walitang  "
177,City launches free wifi for all at public market,"APRIL 2, 2023","  As part of its Smart City and full digital transformation initiatives, the city government led by Mayor Benjamin Magalong launched the free public wifi last March 26 at the Baguio public market that intends to strengthen the digitalization of transactions, trade, and communications in and out of the area.
“This is a momentous occasion for our beloved city as it marks a significant step forward in our efforts to build a more connected and digitally empowered community,” Magalong said about the project that the city has been working on in partnership with Project Lightning of the National Transmission Corporation and in collaboration with Benguet Electric Cooperative.
City Mayor’s Office chief of staff Engr. Felipe Puzon, who also oversees the Management Information Technology Division, said Internet connectivity will be available from the Baguio Market Vendors Association office up to the rice section, Rillera building, and command post.
The project is the first wifi 6 roaming mobility in the country that is free for public use and has a service set identifier or SSID that covers 1.8 kilometers under one wifi access which is backward compatible to any kind of wifi-capable phone, Puzon said.
Magalong said benefits of the project will extend far beyond the convenience of free wifi access since this will strengthen online payments and connect customers with suppliers more easily, and that probably in time, “there will be no need to even come to the market to physically purchase items.”
He said after about four months since the launch of PalengQR, only 1,200 of the public market’s 3,900 entrepreneurs, are registered in the city’s digital payment system due to the lack of Internet connectivity, thus, the need for free wifi access.
“The pandemic has changed the way we live, work, and communicate, and it has underscored the importance of connectivity and access to information. With the launch of this free public wifi service, we are taking a bold step towards bridging the digital divide and ensuring all members of our community have access to the tools they need to thrive in the 21st century,” Magalong said.
The mayor said the initiative would not have been possible without the partnership of Project Lightning, “a team of dedicated professionals who share our commitment to making Baguio City a smarter and more connected place. Project Lightning will showcase what other local government units just dream about – wifi everywhere.”
“As we launch this free public wifi, let us remember that connectivity is not just a privilege, it is a fundamental human right. We must continue to work together to ensure that all members of our community have access to the resources they need to thrive in the digital age. Let us continue to work together to build a brighter and more connected future for Baguio City,” he added. – Gaby B. Keith  "

187,7K tourism workers to train on PH hospitality,"MARCH 26, 2023","FILIPINO BRAND OF SERVICE EXCELLENCE — To level up the quality of service of tourism frontliners in the region, the Department of Tourism-CAR signed an agreement with tourism stakeholders including the private sector, local government units, the academe, and regional line agencies to collaborate for the Filipino Brand of Service Excellence Program of the DOT which targets to train 7,000 tourism frontliners in the region on providing excellent service that banners the renowned Filipino warmth and hospitality. — Hanna Lacsamana  At least 7,000 tourism frontliners in the Cordillera are expected to level up their skills in hospitality through trainings under the Department of Tourism’s Filipino Branch of Service Excellence (FBSE) program.
The program is a nationwide initiative to develop the country’s tourism workforce to provide excellent quality services to tourists and visitors, according to DOT-CAR Director Jovy Ganongan, who led the ceremonial signing of a memorandum of agreement on March 22 for the program’s undertaking with representatives of local government units, regional line agencies, the academe, and private sector.
The FBSE program aims to train 100,000 tourism frontline workers across the country which Ganongan said is a significant step towards radically improving the delivery of the country’s tourism services.
The program emphasizes the world-renowned Filipino brand of hospitality in the provision of tourism services, a distinct trait that if properly maintained and harnessed could serve as the industry’s competitive edge.
Those undergoing the training are those who provide service directly to visitors both domestic and foreign at various touch points namely workers at entry points such as airports and bus terminals, drivers, accommodation front desk staff, dining workers, shopping attendants, vendors, security officers, and tourist police among other frontliners who are expected to make tourists feel the Filipinos’ consistent warmth and hospitality.
The academic community has also been called to support the endeavor to ensure a ready workforce when graduating hospitality students join the industry in the future.
Ganongan said the DOT-CAR has already completed 24 FBSE trainings with 1,179 trained frontliners to date and is targeting to contribute 7,000 out of the 100,000 frontliners to be trained under the FBSE program all over the country.
“We thank our partners for responding to the urgent call to build a strong human resource foundation for Cordillera tourism industry. As you may have observed, the DOT has always regarded capacity building and skills training as critical components of achieving the vision of transforming tourism into a primary engine of socio-economic recovery for the Philippines,” Ganongan said.
She added at this time when tourism destinations in the country and worldwide are vying for better positioning to recover from more than two years of hiatus due to the Covid-19 pandemic, it is always best for all tourism stakeholders to collaborate toward the achievement of the common vision of excellence in providing tourism service.
“The success of the FBSE’s objectives is dependent on how well the region’s will respond to the challenge of pooling resources so that the program becomes a multi-sectoral effort, not just the DOT. We are confident this program could be successfully implemented in the region as dynamic as the Cordillera where the value of cooperation, collaboration and resiliency is evident,” she said.
Ganongan added they anticipate the FBSE trainings will significantly improve the region’s and the country’s image as desirable tourist destination by using the well-known Filipino warmth and hospitality among its tourism frontliners. – Hanna C. Lacsamana  "

190,New checkpoint levels up fisheries control in Abra,"MARCH 26, 2023","  SAN QUINTIN, Abra – A new fisheries quarantine checkpoint was established here in Villa Mercedes to aid in the monitoring and control of fish and fishery products entering the province.
This followed after the conduct of a consultative meeting with fish dealers, concerned local government units, and other stakeholders last week.
BFAR Regional Director Lilibeth L. Signey said effective April 1, all fish dealers entering Abra shall comply with necessary documentary requirements such as the local transport permit.
With the volume of incoming fish and fishery products in the province, BFAR recorded 1,888.98 metric tons of fresh, dried, and processed fishery products in 2022, which adds to the total volume of fish production in the province which is 700.28 MT to meet the Abra’s total fish requirement of 5,275.92 MT.
“This is something relevant for the bureau to strengthen our monitoring initiatives as far as entry of fish and fishery products is concerned since the establishment of a quarantine station is intended for food safety and traceability purposes. It ensures only fishery products which are properly documented, not illegally caught, and safe for human consumption reach the Cordillera,” Signey said.
Through the quarantine station, BFAR will impose strict compliance for the fish dealers to secure their respective local transport permits as required under Fisheries Administrative Order (FAO) 233. The LTP is a permit for domestic movement authorizing an individual to bring, carry, or ship aquatic wildlife, by-products or derivatives acquired from legal sources from the point of origin to the final destination within the country.
A day before inaugurating the quarantine station, a consultative meeting on regulations of domestic/local movement of fish and fishery products was conducted to orient fish dealers, local government units and other stakeholders.
Dennis de Vera of BFAR central office discussed topics relevant to the domestic movement of fish and fishery/aquatic products as well as relevant guidelines in relation to the trade of regulated species and imported fish in all public markets.
Nelda dela Cruz, owner of Power of God Fish Dealer, said they will comply with the directive as they consider such intervention will deny entry of undocumented fish products to the province. – Press release  "

193,SSS La Trinidad to bizmen: Comply with RA 11199,"MARCH 26, 2023","  LA TRINIDAD, Benguet – The Social Security System urged all business employers to fulfill their legal obligations under Republic Act 11199 or the Social Security Act of 2018 during the conduct of Run After Contribution Evaders campaign.
Recently, six employers received written orders from SSS directing them to settle their delinquencies worth P700,000. These employers consist of consultancy offices, retail stores, review centers and food establishments.
“These employers failed to remit to SSS the contributions of their 23 employees. Hence, they must settle the accumulated contribution delinquencies to maintain their workers’ active SSS membership and ensure their eligibility to social security and employees compensation benefits,” said SSS La Trinidad branch head Dominador Malatag.
Qualified SSS members may receive seven benefits such as sickness, maternity, disability, unemployment, retirement, death, and funeral. They can also avail of various loan programs like salary loan, calamity loan, educational loan, housing loan, and pension loan. On top of the benefits and loan privileges, members are also entitled to receive benefits for work-related sickness, injury, or death.
To assist employers with the delinquency, SSS offers contribution penalty condonation program with flexible payment terms-either one-time payment or installment ranging from 12 to 48 months, depending on the delinquency amount.
“Under this program, employers will pay lesser amount since the accumulated penalty will be waived after settling the contribution delinquency,” Malatag added.
SSS Vice President for Luzon North 1 Division Ceasar P. Saludo reminded employers to fulfill their obligations to avoid penalties or legal sanctions set under the Social Security Law.
“Aside from non-remittance of SSS contributions, employers are also mandated to register their business with SSS, and produce updated employment records such as payroll, contribution, and loan collection lists. We recognize our employers as partners in providing social security protection to their workers. However, it is also the prime duty of the SSS to protect the interests of their workers by ensuring their full compliance to the law and provide workers with benefits in times of contingencies,” Saludo said. – Press release  "

206,NCIP execs face Ombudsman case over firm’s expansion,"MARCH 26, 2023","  National Commission on Indigenous Peoples Chairperson Allen Capuyan and Commissioner for Region 1 and Cordillera Gaspar Cayat are facing cases before the Ombudsman for the issuance of certificate of non-overlap to the Northern Cement Corporation (NCC) to renew and expand its operation in Barangay Labayug, Sison, Pangasinan.
In their complaint dated March 16, members of the Bago ethnic group and residents of Barangay Sison, Freddie Castillo and Jessica Doctolero accused the Capuyan and Cayat of grave misconduct, malfeasance and for violating Republic Act 3019 or the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act. 
Members of the Bago ethnic group in the area also trace their roots to Benguet province. The NCC’s plant in Labayug borders Barangay Ansagan in Tuba, Benguet.
The case stemmed from Cayat’s concurrence to the certificate of non-overlap (CNO) issued May 7, 2021 by then NCIP Region 1 Director Manuel Jaramilla. The CNO certifies that the areas being applied by NCC in Labayug are outside any ancestral domain.
The CNO also stated the IP leaders and elders of Sison unanimously supported the issuance of the CNO during a consultation on April 30, 2021. But the complainants said the CNO was unnumbered, which was highly irregular.
The complainants said Free Prior and Informed Consent is mandatory before the issuance of the certificate of precondition and CNO. 
The complainants said the field-based investigation conducted in July 28, 2020 by the NCIP found that the affected area was within an ancestral domain.
“Hence, when the unnumbered CNO was issued on May 7, 2021, respondent Cayat and Jaramilla were already aware of the FBI results and the confirmation that the subject area is within the ancestral domain of the indigenous peoples’ in the area,” the complaint reads.
They said instead of conducting an FPIC as required by law, Cayat made clandestine consultations to obtain the consent of indigenous peoples in the area which is not the procedure set by law.
The complainants said the NCIP officials are liable for grave misconduct, gross neglect of duty, and conduct prejudicial to the best interest of the service for disregarding and violating due process which should be accorded to the IPs they swore to protect.
“It is clear as day of the illegal/irregular and biased acts of respondent Cayat just so he may please NCC/San Miguel Northern Cement Inc. (SMNCI). On the other hand, the toleration and inaction of respondent Capuyan is clearly an indication that despite this obvious irregularity and illegality he just sat on his chair and intentionally looked the other direction,” it stated.
The respondents are also accused of falsification and use of falsified documents by NCC/SMNCI.
The complainants said the NCIP executives are liable for violating RA 3019 for accepting unwarranted benefits to illegally and irregularly issue a CNO despite the presence of the FBI report, objections of the IPs in the affected areas, and absence of FPIC.
Also, Capuyan’s failure to act on such illegality despite his capacity as NCIP chairperson.
The complainants said Cayat should be held liable for the falsification by a public official under article 171 of the Revised Penal Code, including the corporate officials of the NCC/SMNCI for using falsified documents.
The complainants said Cayat took advantage of his position in concurring with the unnumbered CNO that has been certified as non-existent by the NCIP Region 1.
On May 23, 2022, NCIP Region 1 Director Harriet Abyadang sent a letter addressed to Mines and Geosciences Bureau Director Socrates Gaerlan informing him their office has no record of any issuance of a CNO relative to NCC’s application for renewal of Mineral Production Sharing Agreement. 
The complainants said the NCC should also be held liable for using the falsified document and misleading the MGB-Region 1 in thinking the unnumbered CNO was legally issued.

Barangay Tokucan Punong Barangay Eduardo Ngo-oy expressed his gratitude for the provision of government services through the SBDP in their barangay. “Ngayon mas mapapabilis na yung pagdadala ng aming gulay.  Mas makakatiyak tayo na mas mapapaganda yung pamumuhay ng mga tao dito sa aming barangay. Bago ang implementasyon ng SBDP project, ang daan na ito ay maputik at napakadelikado kaya minsan natatagalan kaming dalhin ang aming ng mga gulay sa sentro.”

218,"TO OUR DEAR YOUNG ONES: THERE’S HELP, DON’T DO IT","MARCH 26, 2023","  On the fateful night of March 18, a 16-year-old girl took her own life at Lower Magsaysay in Baguio City.
This young student is now part of a pattern among the youth succumbing to depression or mental illness and serves as a wake-up call for every local government to strengthen their mental health support systems so as to save would-be suicide victims.
Adding to the grief of this tragic incident was the irresponsible sharing of videos, photos and sensitive details of the case on social media.
An earlier incident of an attempted suicide involving a young adult along Bonifacio Street that was also widely circulated on social media might have aggravated the situation of the would-be suicide victims who came across the information.
Over the years, this has been a great challenge to mental health experts, including the World Health Organization, as studies show that such suggestive visuals can have a persuasive power over would-be suicide victims to finally take their own lives.
Before the advent of social media, journalists in the mainstream media observed extreme caution when reporting cases of death by suicide to protect would-be victims from becoming actual victims of this global social and mental health issue.
Traditional media has been cautious in reporting details of suicides such as showing suicide notes of the victims, including the circumstances that led to such incident and how one ended his life.
But those hungry for likes and shares have broken this long-time practice by sharing sensitive photographs and videos of suicide incidents just to gain more followers on social media platforms.
We then call on every citizen to be part of a global advocacy to prevent suicide cases by not taking part in the irresponsible sharing of photographs or videos of deaths by suicide.
The WHO has stated that every suicide is a tragedy that affects families, communities, and entire countries and has long-lasting effects on the people left behind. While suicide tendencies occur throughout a lifespan, among the youth aged 15 to 29 years old, it was the fourth leading cause of death globally in 2019.
So, who are at risk?
According to the WHO, many cases of death by suicide happen impulsively in moments of crisis with a breakdown in the ability to deal with life stresses, such as financial problems, relationship break-ups or chronic pain and illness.
In addition, experiencing conflict, disaster, violence, abuse, or loss and a sense of isolation are strongly associated with suicidal behavior. Suicide rates are also high among vulnerable groups that experience discrimination, such as refugees and migrants, indigenous peoples, lesbians, gays, bisexual, transgender, intersex persons, and prisoners.
More worrisome is the increasing cases of death by suicide among the youth and young adults not only in the Cordillera but also the rest of the country.
Earlier this year, the Department of Education reported it has recorded around 404 young students in various parts of the country who took their own lives while 2,200 others attempted to end their lives during academic year 2021-2022.
DepEd reported further that a total of 775,962 public school students have sought the assistance of guidance counselors during the same period, of which about 8,000 of those cases involved bullying.
It doesn’t end with that.
The Global School-based Student Health Survey, a collaborative surveillance project supported by WHO, reported an uptrend in suicidal thoughts among 13 to 17 years old students in the country.
In this ever complex society, suicide cases will surely be in the uptrend, but this can be prevented with timely, evidenced-based intervention such as empowering every guidance counselor office in all schools nationwide.
Mental health crisis hotlines must also be available especially in social media being the most available and accessible medium of information among people from all walks of life, including those in the countryside.
In coordination with mental health experts, legislators also need to revisit the Mental Health Act to introduce revisions to make it more responsive to the demands of time.
With majority of Filipinos being Facebook users, we also call on lobby groups to call on social media platforms to improve their regulations concerning suicide incidents, and be more aggressive in promoting mental health awareness.
Meantime, we call on every parent, sibling, and friend to reach out to someone they might know suffering from mental health issues and illnesses, especially among our children.
The African proverb that says: “It takes a village to raise a child,” becomes even more significant in this ever complex period.  "
219,Violations surface in Baguio market stalls,"MARCH 26, 2023","STATE OF BLOCKS 3 AND 4 — Temporary makeshift stalls were constructed at Blocks 3 and 4, including nearby roads, at the city public market to help displaced vendors to recover from the fire that gutted the sections where they were selling. — Harley Palangchao  The city government this week has met its target to clean up and start bringing back in one week the vendors displaced by the March 11 fire at Blocks 3 and 4 of the public market.
Mayor Benjamin Magalong on March 20 expressed the city’s gratitude to the individuals and organizations that helped and volunteered in the huge task of cleaning up the debris left by the fire, providing help in cash or kind to build temporary stalls, assisting the affected vendors through cash and food relief, and eventually helping them back to their original stall spaces once the area is safe for them to reoccupy.
“The reason why we were able to make the market rehabilitation in only seven days instead of the projected three months is because of the hard work, the team work, and what we call ‘bayanihan spirit’ where everybody contributed,” he said during the regular flagraising ceremony as the city prepared to turn over the cleaned up market blocks to the vendors.
As of March 20, almost 100 percent of the burned area had been cleaned and cleared while temporary stalls are 80 to 85 percent done.
Market Superintendent Ceasar Emilio said a total of 112 original stallholders can occupy the reconstructed stalls at the left side upper level of Block 3. The vendors transferred to the area that morning.
Emilio said 141 more can return to the right side of the same level upon completion of the canvas roof installations.
The basement of Block 4 is also expected to be finished soon to accommodate the occupants.
City council members, who attended the ceremonial turnover of stalls on March 20, commended all those who helped in making the restoration possible in seven days.
However, some councilors in their March 20 session reported complaints received by their respective offices on alleged irregularities over the awarding of stall slots, bringing out again reported violations on stall lease contracts, particularly on subleasing.
Councilor Jose Molintas said it appears there is some kind of a syndicate in the public market because based on complaints from stall owners received by his office, they were given a number for a slot in the repaired area but later on somebody else was also claiming the spot.
Councilor Lourdes Tabanda also reported somebody came to her office saying when they went to claim their assistance from the city, somebody else has already signed under their name.
“What happened in the market is tragic but it revealed what is really happening there. Do you have any plan to address this situation where persons are claiming rights over the stall whereas those registered awardees are no longer there or even deceased? Do you have any intention to avoid this from happening in the future?” Molintas asked invited resource persons to give updates on the market fire and restoration effort.
City Treasurer Alex Cabarrubias, Emilio, and City Social Welfare and Development Officer Liza Bulayungan have informed council members there is a master list of registered leaseholders from the City Treasurer’s Office.
But after the fire, many of those who come to claim for assistance and get their slots were actually renters who lease the stall from the leaseholders or the registered stall owners with contract with the city government.
Emilio said these actual occupants are asked to present evidence of their actual occupancy of the stall and asked to sign an affidavit stating they are renting the space from a leaseholder.
The councilors asked who between the leaseholder and the renter should occupy the temporary stall.
Cabarrubias said both the leaseholder renting out the stall and the renter should be disqualified since both had violated the Market Code and asked the city council how to properly address this issue, since the market amnesty program of the city already lapsed on April 1, 2022.
The amnesty program was enacted by the city council in hopes of ending various lease violations in the city market such as subleasing and selling of market stalls, among other provisions.
Councilor Isabelo Cosalan Jr. said there is a pending proposal to extend the application period for the amnesty program in light of the fire incident which Cabarrubias considered as a positive move by the city council.
Councilor Peter Fianza said the priority at the moment is to restore the displaced vendors. He suggested suspending any decision as to who between the leaseholder and the actual occupant has better rights over the stall.
Vice Mayor Faustino Olowan said the matter will be discussed further with the executive department. – Hanna C. Lacsamana with reports from Aileen Refuerzo and Jordan Habbiling  "
220,Groups unify action to address suicides,"MARCH 26, 2023","  Mental health illnesses, a health and social concern said to be formerly unlabelled but has actually been happening even before the Covid-19 pandemic triggered such cases, have recently become a subject of public discussions among health professionals – albeit with care and sensitivity – as a way of tackling the issue following recent incidents of self-harm that led to deaths in the city.
The way the recent incidents, captured on video, spread on social media platforms has been described as disturbing, making health professionals appeal to the public to be mindful of their acts and help in preventing suicide.
In separate public forums and online appeals this week, health authorities underlined the need to normalize conversations on mental health issues not only among vulnerable sectors like the youth but also across all ages, in a bid to erase the stigma felt by those who experience mental disorders and as a way of reaching out to provide proper medical advice and intervention, without having to lose a life through self-harm.
Rufina Calub-Abul, head of the Nursing Department of Saint Louis University, shared the World Health Organization has anticipated that mental health illnesses would be the next pandemic and that by 2030, it is expected as the number one global burden of disease that can be caused by several factors.
Abul said these factors include not only the impacts of social media use but also the changing environment and changes in the dynamics of a family where values systems and personality development of an individual emanate.
“At this time we have already unconventional families, with most of our traditions already forgotten. There have been changes, that is why we also now have to adjust the way we deal with our youth of today,” Abul said.
She said while the reason why these recent incidents are taking place cannot be pinpointed, there is a need to focus on putting all the facts together to find out why these are happening.
To date, there are 700,000 reported suicide cases worldwide annually, excluding those with mental health issues and illnesses, according to the WHO.
Department of Education Baguio Medical Officer IV Mary Libeney Sito said mental health issues resurfaced during the pandemic when everybody was restricted and most had experienced anxiety attacks.
She said one who is committing self harm does not necessarily mean he or she has a mental health problem.
“Everyone has mental health, and it is everyone’s concern. Those who commit self harm may have been caused by a disease, and it doesn’t necessarily mean it is due to a mental health issue,” Sito said, explaining that mental health involves the way one thinks, feels, and act; and the capability to reach one’s goals, cope with the stresses of life, and function productively in the community.
Its continuum or range includes one being healthy, reacting, being injured, or being ill, the latter being the one considered as mental health disease or illness, which depending on triggering factors, may lead to breakdown.
“Therefore, we should be careful of our language, especially to the young, because now things are being sensationalized that when one is only sad, it is being called depression or when overwhelmed with assignments, a person already tends to say he or she is having anxiety attack,” she added.
Ricky Ducas, Baguio’s Mental Health Program manager, said the city has recorded six suicide cases – three males and three females – for the first quarter of 2023, with the last two cases belonging to the 15 to 29 years old age group.
In 2022, there were 33 suicide cases, 37 in 2021, and 30 in 2020.
“Our goal is really zero cases. One is too many when we talk about suicide, because it can be prevented,” Ducas said.
In another forum, Genna M. Hipolito, child and adolescent specialist at the Baguio General Hospital and Medical Center Department of Psychiatry, said due to the recent self harm cases captured on video that circulated online, she said the hospital has been receiving more patients consulting about mental health issues, reason why there really is a need to talk about it.
“We need to talk about depression and suicide because of the magnitude of the problem. With the Covid-19 pandemic, mental health problems are a silent pandemic already, and we are seeing it now. The mortality from Covid has been lessened, however mental illnesses are becoming a problem and it is manifesting, especially in our community. We need to talk about it because we cannot afford to lose any life. It is really heartbreaking. Suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem,” Hipolito said.
She stressed the need to not just focus on the problem leading to self harm but on the risk factors because knowing these factors and the symptoms – by the community and the individual concerned – is a key in preventing suicide attempts or addressing mental health issues properly.
“Depression is different from normal sadness. It affects one’s day to day life, interferes with one’s ability to work, study, eat, sleep, and have fun. It is something we see among students. If we are going to compare a student who is not suffering from mental health illness, OK lang sa kanya pero when a person is suffering from depression, anything what we thought is ordinary stress can be a struggle to that person. Waking up in the morning is an effort for them so it is already an achievement because it is not easy for them.
We have to know the symptoms of depression. If we see someone having the feeling of sadness that is persistent, emptiness na minsan na may problema man o wala, it’s there, among other risk factors, we reach out and listen to them and ask them to ask for help. We, the community, play a role in preventing depression and mental health disorders, especially among our students, as well as in preventing suicide,” Hipolito said.
If one is having depression, she said it can be overcome by asking for help as early as one can because if it already becomes severe, an individual no longer has the capability to ask help, which is more detrimental.
She shared what one can do when having difficulties that are making one depressed:
Talk to your parents. If they are the source of depression, there are adult figures who could support you;
It is important to accept and share your feelings, as it is more of a debriefing or processing your feelings. Sometimes we do not need advice, but someone who would be there for us and listen to us;
Try not to isolate yourself. Spend time face to face with friends who make you feel good; Cut back on online time because sometimes things are more stressing in social media;
Get involved with activities that you enjoy. Volunteer in and for the community; and
Be good to yourself. It is underrated, but we need to exercise, get ourselves moving, avoid alcohol and drugs, and aim for eight hours of sleep.
“Remember depression is not your fault or caused by something you did wrong. It is real, treatable brain illness or health problem. If exams are overwhelming, talk to teachers or the school counselor. If you have a health concern, talk to your parents. If you have relationship problems, talk to an adult you trust. If you see a friend who is depressed, talk to them. Encourage them to get help. Stick to them through hard times,” Hipolito said. – Hanna C. Lacsamana  "

While the Covid-19 pandemic was a threat to the face-to-face delivery of nutrition services, in Tublay the “never say die” spirit prevailed among its dedicated health workers as programs still pushed through, like the supplemental feeding for children under the supervision of the Municipal Social Welfare and Development Office, Municipal Nutrition Committee in partnership with barangay health centers and Municipal Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council through rationing of food packs and giving of fresh produce from the Organikong Gulayan sa Health Center Project.

The “Tublay Samaritan Wheels” is also one of the local initiatives during the pandemic which aimed to look for donors to provide three different packages to ease malnutrition in the locality: the “Gamitin mo ako package” which was intended for overweight and obese children consisting of tangible toys; the “Basahin mo ako package” containing nutritional IEC materials for caregivers or mothers and children’s books; and the “Kainin mo ako package” which has dry food packs consisting of nutritious and calorie-dense foods such as insumix, nutribun, monggo beans, and cornmeal.
To ensure the nutrition program implementation in the barangays, the monitoring and evaluation of local level plan implementation pro tool was used as a medium for the evaluation by the municipal nutrition evaluation team composed of five members through an executive order by the Municipal Nutrition Councilchairpersonto award incentives for the best barangay nutrition council,a determining factor on whom the LGU shall award the incentives for best BNCs and barangay nutrition scholars.
Barangay nutrition action officers and midwives were also recognized for their efforts towards nutrition and guiding the nutrition volunteers and support groups in the barangays.

234,Assistance sought for Banaue Rice Terraces restoration,"MARCH 26, 2023","  The mayor of Banaue, Ifugao, which recently created the new brand “Your Stairways to Great Wonders”, is appealing to government agencies and organizations for interventions in its bid to restore the famed Banaue Rice Terraces that is observed to be slowly being converted into gardens.
Mayor Joel Bungallon said though two of Banaue’s barangays, Batad and Bangaan, that have been declared as a Unesco world heritage sites remain intact, some areas of the rice terraces in one of the barangays are converted into gardens due to economic reasons since planting crops is more sustainable for allowing them to harvest three to four times compared to farming rice which is harvested only once a year.
He said being a fourth-class town with minimal fund sources, the municipality cannot sustain the rice terraces and thus needs financial support for the restoration of the rice terraces, including those that are not within the declared heritage site since these remain a part of the tourism site.
“Financially, we cannot sustain the Banaue Rice Terraces that is why we are asking support from the national agencies and other organizations to extend their programs and financial support to maintain it. It is unfortunate the rice terraces are now converted to gardens so we are appealing to help us restore it and so we can prevent the number of areas being converted into gardens from increasing further,” said Bungallon who was among the guests of an event hosted by the Department of Tourism-Cordillera in Baguio City on March 22.
He also considers House Bill 2141, which seeks to create an Ifugao Rice Terraces Commission filed by Ifugao Rep. Solomon Chungalao in July 19, 2022, as their only hope for the recovery, restoration, preservation, and maintenance of the Ifugao rice terraces, considered the only living social and cultural heritage inscribed by in the world heritage list in 1995 by the Unesco.
“If this bill is approved, that will cover five municipalities – Banaue, Mayoyao, Asipulo, Hungduan and Kiangan – which are the areas that have heritage sites as we will have an Ifugao Rice Terraces Commission office and funds will be appropriated for the implementation of its mandate for the restoration, preservation, and maintenance of the rice terraces. If that will not happen, each of these LGUs cannot sustain it because of very low internal revenue allotment as fourth class municipalities. We need interventions of other agencies,” Bungallon said.
Among other functions, the commission will be tasked to immediately formulate a 10-year Ifugao Rice Terraces Master Plan within one year upon its creation and establishment to restore, preserve, and maintain the area’s terraces, protect its ecological balance, and enhance its environment; initiate, plan, undertake and supervise the restoration, maintenance and development of the rice terraces walls, irrigations, dikes, paddies, watersheds, access roads and view decks; and provide livelihood opportunities as an alternate employment for the constituents of these municipalities.
Bungallon said there were already efforts focused on the same purposes where more than P200 million was allocated but the amount was spent for irrigation to support the rice terraces and fields and construction of pathways and riprap to support the area as a tourist site.
He said representatives of a Japanese organization were in Banaue recently and they talked about possible efforts to recover some of the converted areas with their assistance. – Hanna C. Lacsamana  "

The Dallac and Biga ICC signed with the Karayan Hydro Power Corporation (KHPC) and the National Commission on Indigenous Peoples a memorandum of agreement to allow the developer to enter the IP area, establish the feasibility of the project, and continue to comply with other requirements.
The Nanong ICC has yet to reassert its consent. In 2017, after all issues were settled, all three ICCs affirmed their consent, according to NCIP Kalinga Provincial Officer Atty. Catherine Gayagay-Apaling.
The two MOAs were signed by IPs of the Dallac and Biga ICCs; and Jose Silvestre Natividad, director of operations representing KHPC, in the presence of Gov. James Edduba, Vice Gov. Jocel Baac, Karayan Business Development Manager Jay Rommel Alcantara, and Apaling.
“The process doesn’t end with the signing of the MOA since it will be subject for review. The proponent further conducts technical studies, determine areas to be affected, and has to deal with affected land owners,” Apaling explained.
Under the MOA, the host ICCs/IPs shall allow the proponent freedom of access to and peaceful use of the applied area for planning, development, construction, operation and maintenance of the project; commit to amicably resolve disputes between and among its members especially those whose properties will be affected by the construction and operation of the plant using good customs and traditions; and refrain from committing acts that would sabotage the construction and operation of the plant.
Host ICCs/IPs, among other obligations, shall protect and preserve existing communal forest, watersheds or rivers in their respective barangays; account all funds received from the proponent ensuring that the same shall be judiciously spent for the intended purpose, and cooperate with the proponent in the implementation of its corporate social responsibility (CSR) projects and their community development projects.
Other than what has already been granted by law, the host ICCs/IPs shall receive an annual IP royalty benefit share in the amount of 2.5 centavos per kilowatt hour (kWh) of the generated output.
In addition, host IPs shall be entitled to the financial benefits to cover projects for development, livelihood, reforestation, watershed management, health and environment.
The conservative estimate of projected generated output of the project is 185,328,000.00 kWh annually or 4,633,200,000 kWh for the whole 25 years.
Aside from benefits the host ICCs/IPs derive from CSR programs, the KHPC grants continuing educational assistance to 110 college students at P15,000 allowance per semester to Dallac effective upon signing of the MOA and while the project is in commercial operation. Fifteen more scholarship slots at P70,000 educational assistance per semester will be provided to students taking up law, medicine, hydrology and engineering.
The MOA also grants 80 educational assistance slots to Biga ICC at P15,000 allowance per student per semester, among other obligations. – Peter A. Balocnit  "
237,Dad highlights Baguio’s Water Code at UN water conference,"MARCH 26, 2023","  Baguio City Councilor and Philippine Councilors League (PCL) Chair Elmer Datuin was among the delegates invited to speak at the United Nations (U.N.) Water Conference last March 23. 
The U.N. Water Conference has convened local and regional chief executives and legislators around the world to discuss and advocate for the protection of water ecosystems in order to secure adequate water supply. 
In his speech, Datuin highlighted the Water Code of the City of Baguio as a significant piece of legislation that has instituted a legal framework at the local level for a holistic management of water resources and facilities in the city.
Salient provisions of the Water Code as enumerated by Datuin are: the creation of a City Water Resources Board which complements its national counterpart, the National Water Resources Board; the issuance of local water permit to regulate water extraction and to stop the indiscriminate discharge of wastewater; the establishment of monitoring mechanisms in water establishments to improve their environmental compliance; and the setting up of a trust fund based on the “polluters pay principle” to augment and replenish water development financing. 
Datuin said the Water Code is considered as a “pioneering initiative” by a local government unit in Southeast Asia. 
Datuin said a local water governance framework like that of Baguio City can set off the creation of a partnership among the LGU, private and business sectors, academe, and expert groups in the areas of research, technical assistance, access to appropriate technology, and resource mobilization.
He added two priority commitments of Baguio City that are geared towards water protection. These are establishment and management of a database for water concerns; and enhancement of activities already in place such as the inland waterway monitoring and management.
He also mentioned about Baguio City’s Blue Walk project. Activities under this project include the clean-up and restoration of the main creek and tributaries of Balili River and the conservation and rehabilitation of the Busol Watershed. 
All these projects, according to Datuin, have enabled Baguio City to pursue its goals on resiliency, safety, and sustainability. – Jordan G. Habbiling  "
238,ID of trees through QR codes to be piloted at City Hall park,"MARCH 26, 2023","  Those with smartphones visiting the City Hall park may soon scan the QR (quick response) code in individual stands near matured trees for identification of species; common and scientific names, ecological significance, and origin.
This is a step for digitalization from the previous descriptive tree literature in laminated form which withered in the park for years.
The use of QR codes was standardized in the past three years for contactless transactions, individual identification and business purposes. Now a matrix barcode or an optical label containing specific identifying details about anything, including trees, may be captured through the use of a smartphone. 
The idea of QR-coded trees was broached by City Environment and Parks Management Office head Rhenan Diwas after visitors in parks ask the names and other details about local trees, many of which are unknown to many, except to foresters and plant experts.  
The details were worked out by Cepmo Administrative Officer Sandra Almag and forester Floro Bastian, with one month for the codes to be completed. A forester friend overseas who requested anonymity donated an amount enough for 30 QR codes printed in fiberglass which could withstand wear and tear than ordinary plastic, Bastian said.
The first set of tree IDs will probably be at the City Hall grounds before the Holy Week, Bastian said. 
Other tree planting groups have expressed plans to replicate the project at the Botanical Garden, arboretum and other parks, he said. – Julie G. Fianza  "
239,Young Farmers’ School launched,"MARCH 26, 2023","  The city government has launched the Baguio Urban Gardening with the 4H Club (BUG-4H)-Young Farmers’ Field School Program on March 22 at Quezon Elementary School and Joaquin Smith National High School to inform young people on the importance of urban agriculture through the integration of agricultural education in schools.
The activity is pursuant to Ordinance 41, s. 2021 which mandates the conduct of the program.
City Veterinary and Agriculture Office senior agriculturist Marcelina Tabelin said the program hopes to encourage the youth to engage in agriculture to cope up with the ageing population of farmers in the country, thus ensuring food sufficiency.
She said CVAO and the Agriculture Training Institute (ATI)-CAR will conduct the month-long urban gardening coaching/seminar and hands-on gardening at this year’s two pilot public schools, after which participants with be provided with gardening starter kits composed of vegetable seeds, seed tray, seeding bags, garden trowel, and cocopeat compost.
“Throughout the hands-on gardening journey, participants will establish the 4H community urban agriculture model farm which shall serve as their ‘laboratory’ and venue for fellowship to develop their interpersonal relationship as young farmers’ organization that promotes mental health,” Tabelin said. – Gaby B.

240,Non-use of Igorot for Igorots questioned,"MARCH 26, 2023","  The city council has invited an official of the National Commission on Indigenous Peoples to one of its sessions to explain his “rebuke” not to use the word “Igorot” claiming it is associated with the communist movement.
In a resolution approved by the city council on March 20, Councilors Arthur Allad-iw, Jose Molintas, Peter Fianza, Isabelo Cosalan Jr., Fred Bagbagen, and Maximo Edwin Jr. called on NCIP Commissioner Gaspar Cayat to explain a statement made during a public event in 2021 where he said:
“I want to check the impression that in the Cordillera we are called ‘Igorot’. That is a misnomer. Igorot, to Spaniards, simply means savage, backward and uncivilized people. It is not included in the 101 number of indigenous peoples. Just like in Mindanao, we do not have ‘Lumad’. Lumad is a Visayan term referring to a native of a certain place. Again, it is not included in the 101 number of indigenous peoples in our country. Also, in Visayas, they are using this ‘Tumandok’, a word of collective group of people referring to the people in Visayas. But again, it is not included in the 101 number of indigenous peoples. I want to caution or refrain you ladies and gentlemen that these words: “Igorot”, “Lumad” and “Tumandok”, are the very words being used by the CPP-NPA-NDF or the communist terrorist groups,” (CTG) were the words of Cayat.
The councilors said the statement was circulated throughout the social media where it met numerous negative comments and the same has irked indigenous peoples not only those from Baguio but also those who trace their roots to the Cordillera.
They said aside from the resulting confusion, Cayat’s public pronouncement created a “chilling effect” among the IPs in Cordillera, particularly those using the word Igorot, as possible members of the CTGs.
They said in truth and fact, the word “Igorot” as defined and explained by W.H. Scott, one of the country’s irrefutable historians, in his renowned book “The Discovery of the Igorots”, Igorot is a general term used to refer to people from the Cordilleras including the IP groups Isneg, Kalinga, Bontok, Ayangan, Tuwali, Kalanguya, Kankana-ey, Iwak, Karao, Tinguian or Itneg, Balangao and Ibaloy.
These groups have one thing in common which is historically, they have resisted assimilation into the Spanish Empire, the councilors said.
“In the interest of fairness, the City of Baguio, through the sangguniang panlungsod, moved to invite Gaspar Cayat, to answer whether his pronouncement was the official statement of the NCIP and to further elucidate the statement for the information of the sanggunian in aid of legislation,” the councilors stated in the resolution. – Hanna C.

242,Diving pool construction halted due to subpar work,"MARCH 26, 2023","  The city government has decided to discontinue construction of the diving pool at the swimming pool complex of the Baguio Athletic Bowl due to the presence of a sewer beneath it.
City Administrator Bonifacio dela Peña and Councilor Mylen Yaranon reported the excavation done during the construction had caused sewer seepage. The liquid from the sewer seeps into the pool, making it unusable.
Corrective measures were employed to address the leakage but no avail, dela Peña said.
The unfinished diving pool used to be a warm-up pool. Due to the circumstances, Yaranon proposed to revert the diving pool to a warm-up pool in order to maximize use of space. The city council unanimously agreed with the proposal.
Construction of the diving pool was included in the scope of work of contractor, RAG Construction.
Dela Peña said the contract between the city government and RAG Construction needs to be terminated to allow the city government to revert the diving pool to its original form.
Enumerating other reasons why the contract needs to be terminated, dela Peña said the contractor failed to meet the deadline in the rehabilitation of the entire swimming pool complex and also failed to produce satisfactory work.
Despite the city government’s efforts to constantly send reminders and notices, construction problems remained unaddressed, dela Peña said.
He said the contractor’s project slippage and subpar performance are sufficient grounds for termination of contract.
Also, present in the council session, Paul Rillorta of the City Sports Division relayed that the consultant noted the quality of the construction work was unsatisfactory. Up to now, the contractor has yet to rectify the flaws and address the deficiencies, Rillorta said.
Councilor Levy Lloyd Orcales has proposed the blacklisting of the contractor from all infrastructure projects of the city government. He cited his own observation on the contractor’s failure in completing certain components of the project which affected the training of city’s athletes and rendered the city’s learn-to-swim program unimplementable.
Because of the unfinished construction, the swimming pool complex is not yet ready to be used by athletes and the public. – Jordan G. Habbiling  "

Upon the request of the City Engineering Office, the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board-Cordillera granted special permits to these 36 PUJs to ply on the route Baguio City-Ongasan via runway access (Bleeding heart-PEZA), Loakan Road, and vice versa.
These units are divided into odd and even groups. Eighteen units belonging to the odd group are authorized to operate on the said route during odd calendar days while the other 18 units belonging to the even group are authorized to operate only on even calendar days.
In the city council’s session last March 20, LTFRB-CAR Hearing Officer Laird Dionel Urbanozo said the units are not allowed to pick up passengers along roads that are covered by the route serviced by other transport cooperatives. He said this was the agreement during one of the consultations attended by the Loakan Jitney Transport Cooperative and other concerned transport cooperatives.
The request for jeepneys to service the affected community originated from a resolution passed by the city council in December 2022. In the resolution, the city council tasked the City Engineering Office to coordinate with LTFRB-CAR to study the possibility of an additional route.
The BCDEO suggested the city government initiate the acquisition of funds needed for the proposed construction of an alternate route with the help of the Office of Rep. Marquez Go.
Vice Mayor Faustino Olowan and Councilor Benny Bomogao, however, urged the regional office of the Department of Public Works and Highways to consult its Legal Department and find out if the latter can fund the construction of the alternate route in accordance with the Mandanas-Garcia Ruling. – Jordan G.

Offers of proposals can be submitted to the City Planning and Development Office tel. no. 442-6607.
The mayor said parking remains a challenge in the city which needs to be addressed to solve the traffic problem and transportation issues.
He said as of now, only 2,700 parking slots are available in the city as against the demand of 22,000 to 40,000 spaces.
The figure was based on the results of the feasibility study for the three-year smart transport and mobility project of the city which will modernize the city’s public transportation system as a long-term solution to the perennial traffic woes.
To cater to the demand, the city would need around 40 parking structures, the mayor said.
He said at present, the city has identified 11 sites for constructing multi-level parking buildings and it would need more thus the decision to involve the private sector in the pursuit of said project.
The Traffic and Transportation Management Division of the City Engineering Office said Land Transportation Office records showed a total of 49,000 vehicles plying the city’s roads daily based on the number of registered private and public vehicles in 2022.
This does not include the number of vehicles of outsiders including tourists entering the city daily. – Aileen P. Refuerzo  "

250,Fast action on segregation of 13 brgys from John Hay sought,"MARCH 26, 2023","  The Baguio City Council, in a resolution, has requested Mayor Benjamin Magalong to arrange a meeting among city officials, stakeholders, and representatives from the Bases Conversion Development Authority and John Hay Management Corporation to discuss ways on how to hasten the segregation of the 13 barangays from the Camp John Hay reservation.
In their resolution, members of the city council stressed that all concerned individuals must convene to “facilitate the process.”
The resolution took note of the comment of some participants of the public consultation last Feb. 28 that the segregation “is taking too long.”
The 13 barangays eyed for segregation are Country Club Village, Happy Hallow, Greenwater, Hillside, Loakan-Liwanag, Loakan Proper, Apugan-Loakan, Upper Dagsian, Lower Dagsian, Lucnab, Military Cut-Off, Sta. Escolastica Village.
For almost two decades now, the city government has been exerting all efforts to get the commitment of JHMC and BCDA in pursuing the segregation of the 13 barangays in compliance with Resolution 362, s. 1994 set the 19 conditions of the local government for the development of the Camp John Hay Special Economic Zone.
In a meeting between members of the city council and Rep. Marquez Go in 2022, Vice Mayor Faustino Olowan said that JHMC and BCDA had been reminded countless times by the city government to comply with the 19 conditions. However, the vice mayor said these constant reminders seemed to have fallen on deaf ears. A more assertive move needs to be undertaken in order to ensure full compliance, he said.
Members of the former and present city council have been lobbying for the revision of the amendment of the Baguio City charter to address its “deficiencies” including the lack of provisions of the law that would warrant the segregation of the 13 barangays.
In his keynote message during the Feb. 28 public consultation, Magalong himself expressed frustration in the seeming lack of action on the part of BCDA and JHMC to expedite the process of segregating the barangays. – Jordan G. Habbiling  "

252,Breads and pastries enduring time,"MARCH 26, 2023","A taste of the old breads that used to be popular in Star Cafe and City Bakery are still baked by Chiu.  The palate remembers and it asks for more when it stores savory memories of something. That’s when favorites come into play and become indelible. Old timers remember how egg pie tasted good at City Bakery and cinnamon was delicious at Star Café, not to forget the streamline cake at Dainty Restaurant.
All these former Baguio City landmarks have disappeared, but those favorite goodies are still around, thanks to someone who influences it.
Arturo Chiu prides himself as the third generation of a baker from Canton, China who continues the tradition of bringing the quality breads to the table. Like many stories in Baguio, the inter-marriage with women from Kapangan, Benguet have created generations of Chinese descendants who specialize in the trade. In the family of 10, Arturo says five siblings have taken up baking as their occupation, even his next generation of three children are involved in the Bakers Bliss Cake Shop at San Vicente, Baguio City. The surprise is that he is related on the Leung side, or the mother’s side to the del Rosario’s of Sunshine Bakery.
Amidst the struggles in the prices of the ingredients for making the egg pie that has been supplied to popular restaurants like Good Taste and Hotel Supreme, he says that the same milk and quantity of eggs remain the same. The profits may have been reduced but the taste and quality has survived the decades. He says that there should be no compromises in the ingredients to maintain the taste. He laments the shrinking market because the outlets have since included the bakery to their operations. However, the buyers who have become addicted have created a demand for it in some outlets, including the bakery.
The cinnamon rolls of the former Star Café were a regular household item. Arturo was in the staff during the earlier years to maintain the product. The moist and chewy texture of the rolls with the melted caramel topping are similar to the rolls of Tesoro’s. Like the sweet rolls found in commercial shops, this edition of the cinnamon rolls is still different and consistent. The simplicity of the streamline cake of Dainty Restaurant cannot be compared. The rippled plain sugar icing and the sweet corn starch regular lineson plain vanilla chiffon cake were simple versions of fancy ones in most bakeshops. This streamline cake describes the simple icing that made the cake simply delicious. The cake was not found anywhere else in the country but at Dainty Restaurant. Today it remains as a cake made in the bakery of Arturo. This was a middle-class cake used by regular families for household celebrations without the fancy letterings but with candles no less. Arturo says the wood fired ovens have become gas fueled and the mixing of ingredients are now done by machines. Except for the pie crust for the egg pie that is better kneaded, everything that comes out of the bakery is made consistent through the ingredients that remain the same. There are no cheap alternatives used in the changing costs for flour, sugar, and butter. There are no changes in the time-tested recipes. For now, the next generation of bakers in the families have inherited the business sense. There are homemade products that are brought to the shop like the egg pie. The other nieces and nephews are known for their customized cakes for special occasions.
The legacy continues. The Ibaloy Cantonese generations continue the favorites in the American and post-American eras of Baguio City.
The recipes have endured and survived the time because the taste for these items has not waned.  "

258,WEEK’S MAIL,"MARCH 19, 2023","  Nostalgia jam for Dianne in memory of Mondacs It has been years since Baguio and Benguet-based musicians sang together on one stage.
The reasons are personal aside from the fact that most of the naturally talented folk and country musicians in the localities had to face the realities of economics, or earning a living somewhere here or in a foreign land, getting married and raising a family of their own, and looking after grandchildren now.
The last time some of the Baguio musicians sang together on one stage was in February 2019. More singing was scheduled but this was interrupted by the lockdowns due to the Covid-19 that prevented travel.
At the Francis Resto-Bar along Cruz, La Trinidad, Benguet on March 25 from 5 to 9 p.m., the public is invited to again listen to the musicians in a benefit gig for cancer patient Dianne Escuadra, the beautiful daughter of a fellow musician.
The mini-concert dubbed “Nostalgia Jam” which will be shown real time on social media platforms will feature “oldies but goldies” songs that were sung in the folk houses in Baguio.
It is also in memory of the late journalist-cum-civic leader Ramon “Mondacs” Dacawi, who was supportive of benefit concerts.
Singer-musicians Conrad Marzan and Richard Arandia, coming home all the way from California to perform in the benefit jam, will be joined by Sammy Comiles, Arsen Marzan, Bubut Olarte, Paul Coyupan, Serrafin Marzan, Art Tampoa; the trio of Liza, Alma and Dianne; Alfred Dizon, Alan del Rosario, Boy Cacho, yours truly, and Banjo.

259,"Water, woman, culture","MARCH 19, 2023","  The Samaritan woman said to Him, “How can you a Jew, ask me, a Samaritan woman, for a drink?”(John 5:9)
The woman was aloof because she was aware of the law that Samaritans must not communicate and relate with Jews.
But Jesus communicated to the woman for a higher purpose. He initiated the conversation because Jesus wanted the woman’s conversion. Jesus did not offer just water but salvation to the woman.
Jesus broke the cultural norm that almost suppressed the salvation of the woman. The norm alienates the woman from Jesus. But Jesus spells the salvific law of communion.
This is a big lesson for us indigenous peoples. We must admit that there are elements or aspects of our culture that suppress the growth of our faith and even cultural norms and practices that impose fear to people in order to obey a ritual that is against the will of a person or a family.
There are also aspects of our culture that demand to butcher animals beyond the economic reach of a family.
Culture, truly, is our identity but we are Christians baptized in Jesus. The law of Jesus supersedes any law. Hence, let us open our cultural identity and cultural norms and practices to be blessed and purified by the gospel of Jesus. Only then can we converted fully and be disciples of Jesus.
Jesus said to his disciples: “Do not think that I have come not to abolish the law or the prophets. I have come not to abolish but to fulfill.” (Matthew 5:17)
We can see the beautiful progress of the woman’s conversion.
At first, Jesus was a stranger to the woman. Then Jesus became a sir. Then the woman started to see the unique features of Jesus and treated him as a prophet. Finally, Jesus revealed himself as the Messiah to finally change the heart of the woman to a believer. Salvation dawned on the Samaritan woman because of Jesus’ offer, “Give me something to drink.”
The beautiful story of Jesus and the Samaritan woman is a celebration of Women’s Month. Jesus showed impartiality to lift the dignity of a woman. Besao is one of the most peaceful towns of Mountain Province.
On arrival in Besao, I took the chance to roam and look for good coffee. The first restaurant I entered informed me that brewed coffee is rarely served in restaurants.
I was a bit disappointed. But when I entered the Besao Municipal Police Station, the policemen welcomed me and offered overflowing coffee.
I also learned from the people and from the police of Besao there is no “inuman” in town. Nobody stays late in the evening as people are aware of the curfew.
Besao MPS OIC Capt. Janice Pating appreciates the collaboration of the community and the police in the promotion of peace especially in the Poblacion. I simply said, “Sana all!”
I was elated to be with the Besao police and it was their first time to join a spiritual upliftment.
Besao MPS under the baton of a beautiful and snappy woman spells Women’s Month. Janice is an example of the motto, “Life is beautiful.” She is proof that women are indeed capable leaders. Women are naturally born with intuition. Women are the best bearers of hope at home, in the community, and in every difficulty. Happy Women’s Month! You are invited to the Marcsongs concert on March 30.

260,Life in academia,"MARCH 19, 2023","  My lovely 80-year-old mother, Dr. Emma Baban Keith, has been an educator most of her working life, from being an elementary-to secondary-to college instructor then becoming part of school management until she retired.
That’s not counting, of course, her being teacher and guide, until now, to three children and two grandchildren on how to lead Christian lives. She’s trying anyway especially with this near-sighted Ibaloy writer.
Meanwhile, my late father, Atty. Gabriel Pawid Keith, who would have turned 90 years old on March 30, also taught for a few semesters at the graduate school of Baguio Central University where I also happen to have earned my Masters in Public Administration and PhD degrees.
The slacker that I am, it took me about five years to finish my MPA and around seven years to earn my PhD. As they say, slowly but surely.
However, even if both my parents have been members of the most noble profession – that’s teaching, if you didn’t know, I never thought in my wildest dreams that I would be a part of this since I honestly believed I didn’t have the patience, competence, wisdom, or whatever is needed to be an effective teacher. Besides, I saw my mother still hard at work grading papers into the wee hours of the night when I was much, much younger. And I won’t even go into teacher salaries back then. I do hope they’re better now.
It was no less than Dr. Felipe Comila, president of Benguet State University,a center of excellence, who called me out of the blue offering me to be an adjunct (part-time) professor in its College of Public Administration and Governance (CPAG).
As expected, I was hesitant to accept his offer, generous as it was, because of the reasons I just mentioned plus the fact that I have never taught a class in my life. Lectures, yes, but never for an entire semester.
In the end, Dr. Comila was able to convince me to try even for just one semester with a three-unit teaching load every Saturday from 7 to 10 a.m. My subject was on administrative communication.
Well, almost two months and I’m actually loving every moment of academic life. I honestly feel that my students, all of whom are professionals from the government and private sectors (including a foreigner), are learning something from me (that’s what they tell me anyway) and I am learning even more from them. I never thought teaching could be so much fun and fulfilling. Of course, being only human, I must admit that it’s also great to be called a “Dr.”, even only on Saturdays. One day lang naman so I hope I don’t get bashed for it especially in a crab-infested society we live in.
Thank you Dr. Comila for giving me this wonderful opportunity. May your tribe increase. At least I could put my Ph.D. to good use. Here’s hoping that I would be a part of BSU’s teaching staff for years to come. Even on a part-time basis only and maybe full-time in the future. Who knows? Sana everyday is Saturday.
May our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ continue to bless and keep us all safe.  "

262,Team Lakay exodus saddens fans of top PHL MMA team,"MARCH 19, 2023","TEAM LAKAY DYNASTY GONE — The departure of former ONE Championship world champions Eduard Folayang, Kevin Belingon, Honorio Banario, and Joshua Pacio from Team Lakay has left a vacuum in the top mixed martial arts gym in Southeast Asia. Team Lakay founder and chairman Mark Sangiao has assured that concerned parties maintain civility and wished them good luck in their future endeavors. — ONE file photo   Prior to the announcement of the exit of four former world champions of the fabled Team Lakay, there was a talk with the group and individually, according to head coach Mark Sangiao. Team Lakay fighters Eduard Folayang, Kevin Belingon, Honorio Banario, and Joshua Pacio, all former ONE Championship world champions, have confirmed they have parted ways with Team Lakay through their Facebook accounts, which left fans speculating on various issues like in-fighting within the team or the fighters’ being recruited to other gyms.  In an interview with Bombo Radyo Baguio, Sangiao said he was saddened with the fighters’ decision but he gave his blessings to them so that they would venture out well. “I am saddened with their decision but for me as their manong, I am happy with what they have achieved. With their decision, there’s nothing I could do but to accept it because I know they really thought hard about it,” Sangiao said. Sangiao said even siblings have misunderstandings, how much more to them as a team. He said Team Lakay stayed this long because they would always talk things out. It was an emotional moment for the remaining members of Team Lakay, especially the younger generations of the departure of their manongs, but Sangiao reminded them to focus on their goals as there would always come a time when people would part ways.  Folayang echoed this in a separate interview in the same radio station, saying there is no easy way to say goodbye especially with Sangiao, who is like a brother to him. “I said thank you for all those years we have been together.” “I explained to him that I need to try a different path so I could discover more and unleash my remaining potential,” Folayang said.  The former two-time ONE lightweight world champion was the first of the four to announce his exit but said there is no grudge between him and Sangiao. His decision was purely to improve his remaining active years in fighting after being with Team Lakay for 16 years. Folayang is considered as the poster boy of Philippine mixed martial arts being the main fighter in  the maiden fight of ONE Championship in 2011.    Folayang said it took him a lot of prayers and consultation with his family and inner circle before arriving at his decision.  “Siyempre nadagsen ta nakanayon ti nagan ko ti Team Lakay. And yet maminsan ada nga talaga kailangan decisions that need to be made, especially if you still want the vision that you saw years back to be intact until now. So I think I don’t want to be stuck. I don’t want to waste the remaining active years of my career,” he said. The 39-year-old Folayang said he will still fight under ONE Championship, but will carry and build his own brand. He said he is open to training in other gyms and trainers as he starts getting invites from other MMA fighters such as Martin Nguyen and Cris Cyborg Justino. The 27-year-old Pacio, meanwhile, thanked Sangiao and Team Lakay for honing him through the years which helped him become a world champion. But he said he needs to step out of his comfort zone to level up his skills. “In my quest to better myself and reclaim the belt that was once mine, I have decided that moving out of the fabled stable that gave Filipino fight fans much to cheer for inside the circle is the path that I have to take,” Pacio said in his Facebook post. Only former ONE flyweight world champion Geje Eustaquio remains in Team Lakay where he held four belts simultaneously in 2018. Fans wished the four fighters well and blessed them with their decision. – Ofelia C. Empian  "

Sangiao, son of Team Lakay head coach Mark Sangiao, is set to collide with Argentina’s Matias Farinelli in a three-round bantamweight encounter, while Zamboanga is penciled to take on Brazil’s Julie Mezabarba in the women’s atomweight joust. Sangiao holds an immaculate professional record of five wins with four victories by submission and one via knockout. The “Little Machine” is also 2-0 under the ONE Championship banner.  In his most recent outing last December, he forced ONE Warrior Series Philippines alum Anacleto Lauron to tap with a wrenching rear-naked choke in the first round. His scintillating performance earned him a $50,000 bonus. Farinelli, on the other hand, is an Argentinian standout from the world-recognized Tiger Muay Thai in Phuket, Thailand. Farinelli is also 5-0 record holder, but all of his career wins have come by way of submission. Both men were originally slated to face each other at ONE 164, but Farinelli withdrew from the bout after testing positive for Covid-19. As a result, Lauron filled in for him to square off with Sangiao. Zamboanga, meanwhile, rebounded from back-to-back losses with a razor-thin split decision win over China’s Lin Heqin at ONE Fight Night 5 last December. Zamboanga hopes to get back into the world title conversation by defeating Mezabarba at ONE Fight Night 9 in April. However, it will not be a walk in the park for Zamboanga as Mezabarba has been proven to be no slouch of an opponent. The Brazilian vixen first gained attention by scoring an upset against former world title challenger Mei Yamaguchi.  Although she lost her next two assignments opposite Stamp Fairtex and Jenelyn Olsim, Mezabarba went the distance with them and made sure that they would have to earn their victory the hard way. – ONE release  "

269,Kahit maputi na ang buhok ko,"MARCH 19, 2023","  “Kung tayo ay matanda na, sana’y di tayo magbago kailanman…” awit ni Rey Valera na nagpapaalala sa atin na umuusad ang panahon, kaya’t bawat minuto ay bigyan ng halaga. Parang kailan lang, nagmamadali tayo sa paghabol sa panahon. Naging bata, naglaro ng luksong tinik, holen, pikit-mata, tumbang preso, patintero, piko, sipa, turumpo, at kung anu-ano pang mga lumang laro.
Wala pang mga gadyet noon; walang selpon at maka bagong teknolohiya. Walang salitang boomers, Gen X, Y and Z. At lalung-lalo na wala pang Covid-19.
Nag-aral, nagtrabaho, nag-asawa, nag-retire sa trabaho, nagka-apo at ngayon marahil ay nag-aalaga ng apo (“apostolic” ang tawag nila), nabiyuda o nabiyudo o kaya ay may ibang pinagkakaabalahan sa panahong natitira. Sadyang may buhay pa pagkatapos magretiro, kahit maputi na ang buhok natin. Marami pang dapat gawin kahit hindi tayo teki (techie).
Marami pang daan at magagandang lugar ang lalakbayin habang kaya pa. Nagpipilit matuto ng wika at gawa ng kabataan. Sinasalubong natin sa gitna ang karunungan at panahon. May bago nga akong natutuhan kay Nonnette Bennett sa isang pagpupulong ng BGH Advisory Board.
Kung mayroong “marites” ay meron ding “tolits” (tol ano ang latest?). ‘Di ba masaya Chair Ram Sharma, Atty. Joseph Rulla, Glo Jasa, Dr. Florence Reyes, Marie Ragma, Fe Belita, Magda Dawawong, Joey Rulla, at Kristine Sameon? Pero hindi pa maputi ang buhok nina Tintin, Marie, Joey at Magda, junior citizens pa sila. Sadyang masarap magbalitaan.
It’s compromising and sharing still what wisdom you have acquired in the past and the present. Yes, there is life after retirement. We cannot just sit around and wait for the coming dawn. It’s learning and continuing to learn, after all, education is not just for the young. We wonder where all the years went. We ask ourselves if we have lived the life; if we have taught our children well; if we have given them unconditional love.
If we have made enough contribution to humanity so that when the time comes, we can answer God, how much we have touched other people’s lives.
Did we deposit to God’s bank account in this journey called life? When we are young, we just think of the present. We forget sometimes that we are just passing this stage in life and that we should always be humble. We are, after all, somewhere in the dash of life.
We strive to earn money and more money, own material things, have fame and fortune. Sometimes we soar high with the taste of power. We forget compassion. We are unaware that everything passes in due time. As they say, beauty fades, fame diminishes, health fails when you get older, money is important but not so important when you are ill or when there are catastrophes.
You wonder why you got sick when you were so careful with food and regimens and yet it still happens. We stop denying that now we have wrinkles. We are getting curves and mountains in the wrong places. Our skin is getting soggy. What we used to do in minutes, takes us hours now.
But still, even if the body gets old, we still want to do the things we did before. We notice though that we now walk slower, our eyesight gets blurred sometimes, forget things where we left them, like eyeglasses on our heads or where we left our keys and yes even cars.
It becomes harder to get thoughts organized. Even if the body and mind gets old, the soul stays young and cheerful. And the best part is, the mind still remembers happiness and past experiences.
We must still love ourselves, not the ego type but the pure kind, the gift from God.
Kaya nga tinatanong ko ang sarili ko. Bakit ba wiling-wili ako manood ng mga telenovela? Kinikilig sa mga nagmamahalang kabataan. Nalulungkot kapag ang istorya ay mayroong malungkot na katapusan. Kung manood ako ay tinitignan ko muna ang mga unang episodes ng teleserye, pagkatapos ending na. Kasi ‘di ko na itinutuloy ‘pag malungkot ang ending, gusto ko happy ending lang. Bakit ko pa papahirapan ang damdamin ko na mag-isip at umiyak? Pero kapag maganda ang ending ng istorya ay papanoorin ko ang buong telenobela at kung minsan paulit-ulit pa. Madaya ano?
Kaya nga kahit maputi na ang buhok ko, gusto ko pa rin maging masaya. Gusto kong isipin na ang mundo ay iskuwelahan ng buhay. Gusto kong umakyat nang baytang, matuto, makatulong, at mayroong pagkaabalahan. Ang pera ay nauubos, ang katanyagan kumukupas, at ang mga gantimpala nawawalan ng saysay – nagiging palamuti na lamang. Pero ang mga pundar at puhunan mo sa buhay kagaya ng pamilya, kaibigan, pagmamahal, pakikipagkapwa-tao, pakikisama, kabaitan, pag-unawa sa kapwa, at pagtulong ay mananatili sa kaisipan at puso ng mga taong nakasalamuha mo. Nakaukit yan.
Yes, life is beautiful.  "

The launching ceremony on March 15 was led by Mayor Romeo Salda, Davies PaintsVice President Albert Gan Lee who will sponsor the paints, Chanum Foundation President Jordan Mang-osan who spearheaded the Tam-awan artists in redesigning the artwork and will oversee volunteers and hired painters for the project, and Venus Marie Tan, the former director of Department of Tourism-Cordillera, who led the project in 2016. — Ofelia Empian  As a tourists’ attraction in La Trinidad, Benguet, the Stobosa hillside mural artwork will undergo repainting for a fresh design and splash of colors seven years after the launch of the project.
Municipal Tourism Officer Valred Olsim said the project was supposed to be repainted prior to the pandemic. 
With the reopening of tourism, Olsim said the municipal government has recently coordinated with the residents of Sitios Stonehill, Botiwtiw, and Sadjap, from which Stobosa was coined, for the project. The residents gave their consent for the repainting project.
“There are those whom we made a compromise regarding the design and colors to be used in their homes but majority agreed with the project,” Olsim said.  
Chanum Foundation president Jordan Mang-osan said they were tapped anew to lead the repainting through the designs created with Tam-awan artists, which will feature symbols of La Trinidad and the province of Benguet.
Chanum Foundation manages the Tam-awan artists and its village located in Pinsao Proper, Baguio City.  The Tam-awan artists were also the ones originally tapped to lead the Stobosa painting in 2016.
Mang-osan, who is known for his solar artworks, is from Bayabas, La Trinidad. He said he is more than happy to work with the local government unit, residents and volunteers for the project.
Former Department of Tourism-Cordillera Director Venus Tan also graced the ceremony, thanking the municipality for sustaining the project, which she helped start through her region-wide RevBloom tourism program in 2016.
Tan said the Stobosa artwork is initiated to be more than just a beautification project but more on empowering the community to care for its environment and to provide livelihood opportunities to the residents.
The artwork was patterned after the colorful favelas (slums) in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil which was also an effort by its government to beautify its city, with the intention of improving the state of its residents from the inside out.
“I still feel I need to support the advocacies I started as a regional director. You can count on me for support to help link the community with other people for assistance,” Tan said.
Davies Vice President Albert Gan Lee recognized the impact the painting and repainting of Stobosa gave to the residents in the area.
Lee said the paint company is happy to partner with the LGU and other stakeholders for the project where they will provide 2,000 paints including primer.

Benguet Gov. Melchor Diclas, DA-CAR  Technical Director for Operations Danilo Daguio, Mankayan Mayor Dario Banario, Manpat-A Farmers Association president Basilio Ngaseo Jr., Aboitiz Equity Ventures VP for Transformation Dea Franko Csuba, and Hedcor President and COO Rolando Pacquiao showed the first crates of vegetables to be stored in the unit. — Contributed photo  In line with its program to become the Philippines’ first techglomerate, the Aboitiz Group launched Fresh Depot, which seeks to become the first ever physical and digital solutions platform for farmers in the country.
Its first phase involves piloting a modular and sustainable cold storage unit in Mankayan, Benguet, with the vision of helping farmers reduce their post-harvest losses and maximize crop yield.
“Fresh Depot aims to transform the lives of farmers by offering a platform that optimizes their yield and income while reducing waste, making a significant contribution to our country’s food security,” said Aboitiz Group President and Chief Executive Officer Sabin Aboitiz.
“Uplifting the agricultural sector and our farmers is crucial to strengthening our food supply chain and reducing our reliance on imports. We see various opportunities to make an impact in this sector and this is just one of the many projects we’re working on,” he added.
According to a study by the Institute of Food Science and Technology of the University of the Philippines-Los Baños, about 42 percent of locally grown produce goes bad before it can be eaten, and farmers, consumers, and other supply chain players are suffering for it.
In 2020, the Department of Agriculture underscored the need to establish more cold storage facilities in the country. This was echoed by the Philippine Chamber of Agriculture and Food Inc. (PCAFI), highlighting that it can reduce post-harvest losses and improve farmers’ income.
In the Philippines, however, most cold storage facilities are located near urban areas and are used for storing meat and other frozen products. These conventional, energy-guzzling cold storages are not built for farmers, who need farm-level and affordable cooling facilities for their crops.
In addition to offering sustainable modular cold storage, Fresh Depot’s second phase will involve digitizing farmers’ land, and planting practices, pre-harvest, harvest, and market information. Digitization will allow Fresh Depot to offer advisory services, explore market linkage opportunities and financial inclusion programs, as well as build a database of information that the government can use for their agricultural programs.
This pilot, which will initially run for three to six months, will become a case study for this new type of enterprise, which Aboitiz hopes to scale up across other farm locations in the Philippines if proven viable. Ultimately, Fresh Depot is envisioned to assist the government in enabling millions of farmers.
Among those in attendance during its pilot launch in Mankayan were Benguet Gov. Melchor D. Diclas, Mankayan Mayor Dario Banario, Department of Agriculture-Cordillera Technical Director for Operations Danilo Daguio, Nueva Vizcaya Agricultural Terminal (NVAT) Chair James P. Estong, NVAT General Manager Gilbert Cumila, EcoZen Solutions President Ravindra Dolare, Hedcor President and Chief Operations Officer Rolando Pacquiao, and Aboitiz Equity Ventures Vice President for Transformation Dea Franko Csuba.
Aboitiz is planning to launch a second pilot location in the next few weeks.
Fresh Depot is working with Mankayan’s Manpat-A Farmers Association for its first pilot site of the cold storage unit. – Press release  "

In NNC-CAR’s letter to the lawmakers, Regional Nutrition Program Coordinator Bella Basalong wrote despite NNC’s vital role in leading the country’s fight against malnutrition, it has remained a small agency since its creation in 1974, with less than 100 staff combined central and regional offices.
Pending at the Congress is House Bill 6501 or the “Act Strengthening the National Nutrition Council Repealing for this Purpose Presidential Decree 491, Expanding its Powers and Functions, and for other Purposes” or the “Nutrition Act of 2023” filed by Cagayan de Oro 2nd District Rep. Rufus Rodriguez on Dec. 6, 2022.
The bill highlights the change in the institution classification of the agency from a council to a commission with changes in its organizational composition, additional functions, and responsibilities, and increased human resource.
“This would result in a strengthened NNC. A strengthened NNC can respond more effectively and efficiently to the persistent malnutrition in our country. It would also result in an improved and strengthened overall system of coordination and implementation of nutrition governance at all levels. We humbly request your honorable representation to sponsor/co-sponsor HB 6501 to realize this change,” Basalong said.
As the highest policymaking and coordinating body on nutrition in the country, the NNC is tasked to formulate national food and nutrition policies and strategies, coordinate planning, monitor and evaluate the national nutrition program, and serve as the policy, coordinating and advisory body on concerns related to food, nutrition, and health.
It draws its mandate from PD 491, s. 1974 or the Nutrition Act of the Philippines.
The proposed Nutrition Act of 2023 seeks to appoint a chairperson and two commissioners with the rank of undersecretary to be appointed by the President.
The commission, if approved, is tasked among its duties, functions, and responsibilities to formulate an integrated and multi-sectoral national policies, programs, activities, and projects on nutrition and food to ensure good nutrition and food security and eliminate malnutrition.
In his explanatory note, Rodriguez said data show 4,844 Filipinos died of malnutrition in January to October 2021 compared to 3,514 in the same period in 2020. The Philippines also ranked fifth among countries in East Asia and the Pacific region with the highest prevalence of stunting in 2019 and among 10 countries globally with the highest number of stunted children.
The country also showed very minimal progress in addressing its undernutrition, with overnutrition becoming a significant concern.
“The government must therefore take aggressive steps to immediately solve these perennial problems. The bill will provide a permanent nutrition framework aligned to the overall national policy of the government, especially the Philippine Development Plan,” Rodriguez stated in the bill. – Hanna C.

This makes La Trinidad the first LGU in Benguet to launch a smoke-free tourism area.
Mayor Romeo Salda thanked their partners in the implementation of the Smoke-Free Ordinance of La Trinidad, which prohibits smoking cigarettes and e-cigarettes in all public places, public conveyances, and workplaces.
He said he will push for the signing of a memorandum of agreement between the LGU and the organization of vendors to ensure that the Strawberry Farm is a smoke-free tourism area.
“Nu awan ti kooperasyon yo met laeng, awan ti mangyari. I hope that we will be having a memorandum of agreement a dakayo ti katulungan mi tapnu masigurado nga awan ti cigarette butt a makita ditoy,” Salda said.
Vice Mayor Roderick Awingan said the launching is also about renewing the strong program relative to the Smoke-Free ordinance of the municipality.
He said the local council is reviewing the possible merging of the Vaping Regulation Ordinance and Smoke-Free Control Ordinance, which have the same objective which is health promotion.
“We really want that the constituents of the municipality of La Trinidad and those who come to La Trinidad will be healthy. It’s because in La Trinidad, we disallow, regulate smoking and at the same time, vaping in public places,” said Awingan.
Smoke-Free Benguet Project Manager Cecile Agpawa said the event signifies the start of having all places smoke-free, especially those frequented by tourists.
She said environment, tourism, and health are interrelated, thus the need for the program.
“It is not a stand-alone program, but it should be integrated in all the other programs. Not only for health, also for tourism, and later on for the economy of our community,” Agpawa said.
The attendees pledged to advocate a healthier well-being of all Filipinos through the promotion of tobacco-free, vape-free, and betel quid-free lifestyle; participate and advocate responsible and healthy tourism; and to continuously work with partner agencies and stakeholders for the enforcement of the La Trinidad Smoke-Free Ordinance.
“We welcome economic growth through tourism and business growth but it should always not be at the expense of the communities’ health. The municipality is stepping up its level of implementation of smoke-free program. As we continue to level up the implementation of this smoke-free program, we ask everyone to sustain the support and the partnership we have,” Municipal Health Officer Antonette Agpas said.
Councilors Belmer Elis and Guiller Galwan, barangay officials, Dr. Genevieve Wagang-Degay, and representatives from the Department of Health-Cordillera, Benguet Provincial Health Office, women’s brigade, other government agencies, and the organization of vendors in the Strawberry Farm were also present during the launching. – Debbie E.

298,"Forest, grass fires in city caused by burning wastes","MARCH 19, 2023","  Burning garbage and lighted cigarette butts are the most common causes of grass and forest fires in Baguio, according to the Baguio City Fire Bureau.
BFP Supt. Marisol Odiver reported a total of 28 fire incidents happened in Baguio from January to the first week of March this year where 14 or majority were forest fires, eight were structural fires, and six were vehicular fires.
Odiver said most of the fire incidents were due to human activities such as burning garbage and lighted cigarettes which ignite grass and forest fires when unattended.
Last year, the BFP Baguio responded to 57 fire incidents wherein 40 were structural; four each grass, rubbish and vehicular fires; three forest fires, and two electrical fires.
Odiver said the structural fires were private residences, which are not required to secure a fire safety inspection certificate unlike commercial establishments.
BFP Baguio continues to educate the public on fire safety prevention and control through social media and traditional media announcements to avoid loss of life and property when fire incidents happen.
Odiver appealed to the public to ensure they can contribute in the prevention of fire incidents by making sure they always close their gas tanks and put off lighted candles before leaving their houses.

As of March 13, the fire was still ongoing but has subsided.
Pagnas added they are coordinating with nearby barangays for possible intervention in case the forest fire further spreads. – Hanna C. Lacsamana  "

This includes the immediate temporary relocation of a total of 1,640 vendors who lost their stalls, as well as for relief assistance, including komboys who were also displaced.
The budget will also be used for supplies needed for the restoration of the roof at the livestock area at Block 4 and supplies and equipment for the put-up of temporary stalls by the City Buildings and Architecture Office and volunteers.
The city council also granted the request for the use of Kayang St. and Hilltop Road, as well as the Igorot Garden and Malcolm Square for the affected vendors to sell their wares.
The councilors, however, stressed to see to it the vendors or their products are zoned properly and only those who are affected are the ones to be given relocation spaces.

304,Spirit of bayanihan alive at city market,"MARCH 19, 2023","  Personnel from various City Hall departments government and civilian volunteers since day one are not letting up in the effort to clean up and eventually build back the burned areas of the city public market, which went up in smoke night of March 11, disrupting the livelihood and temporarily displacing more than a thousand of market vendors.
The cleanup at the ground zero of the fire was ongoing as of March 17, led by Mayor Benjamin Magalong who was among the first to respond at the scene after the fire broke past 11 p.m. of March 11 and was helping the teams from the Bureau of Fire Protection until fire-out was declared around 4:30 a.m. of March 12.
The Public Order and Safety Division, City Market Superintendent Office, City Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council, General Services Office, sangguniang panlungsod, some of the market vendors themselves, as well as contingents from the Armed Forces of the Philippines and Philippine National Police and volunteers responded to the call of the mayor for a seven-day cleanup drive starting March 13.
From midweek to March 17, city department personnel and volunteers, including carpentry students from the Technical Education and Skills Development Authority started constructing temporary stalls in identified relocation areas for the 1,640 market stall owners affected by the fire.
Donations such as water, sacks, and food also poured in for assistance aside from the relief packs distributed by the Department of Social Welfare and Development.
City Fire Marshall Supt. Marisol Odiver said based on investigation, the massive fire that gutted Blocks 3 and 4, two of the newer portions of the public market, started at the wagwagan section near the chicken livestock at the Block 4 extension, which had highly combustible materials, and quickly spread to the other sections.
The fire may have also quickly spread considering the huge amount of fuel in the area used in some of the stalls.
Odiver said they have submitted pieces of evidence to the BFP national headquarters that were collected during the fire scene analysis using the National Fire Protection Association standards, arc mapping, and identification of patterns.
Statements from witnesses were also taken.
Magalong earlier said the city will use forensic examination to determine the cause of the fire.
“Hindi basta-basta visual ‘yan. Parang krimen din ‘yan. Dito natin malalaman kung paano talaga nag-umpisa at ito ay isinasagawa ng BFP to once and for all dispel ang mga intriga at kasinungalingan na ipinapakalat,” he said.
The mayor right after the fire and the start of rehab drive had also appealed to the public to help, be sensitive, and not to spread rumors as to the cause of fire.
“Let us not fan rumors and gossips that shall only make matters worse than it already is. Let us be respectful of each other’s sensibilities, avoiding public jokes and baseless comments that the fire was purposely done for selfish interest. This level of reaction to a public tragedy serves no purpose than to belittle the plight of the fire victims. It also disregards the sacrifice that our frontline responders offered in putting the fire under control,” the mayor said in a statement posted in his official social media account.
As of press time, Fire Insp. Bernard Bravo of the BFP-Cordillera said the city was still waiting for the results of the laboratory examination of the collected specimens such as ashes and electrical wirings which local authorities forwarded to the laboratory service.
He added they have also coordinated with the city government to provide documents such as floor and electrical plans of the affected buildings which may be needed if another site inspection will be conducted.
The city council on March 17 also granted the request of the Office of the City Mayor for the allocation of supplemental P8 million to be used for the market rehabilitation efforts and use of certain roads and parks as temporary relocation sites for the affected fire victims. – Hanna C.

305,BAMBOO FOR GREENHOUSE,"MARCH 19, 2023","BAMBOO FOR GREENHOUSE — Farmers transport the bamboo they bought from traders along Shilan, La Trinidad, Benguet, for them to use as frames for their greenhouses or alternative to wood in their construction needs.

306,Dung operators told to call for regulation,"MARCH 19, 2023","  With the closure of the 10 chicken dung establishments at Shilan, La Trinidad, Benguet on March 14, the municipality has urged the operators to transfer to other towns, or to lobby for its regulation.
Municipal Legal Officer Victor Singa, Jr. said the operators can continue seeking assistance from the municipal council to craft an ordinance for the regulation of the chicken dung trade since it is not a contraband.
“We are responding to the complaints of the residents that it is smelly and the municipal government has no basis to give them permits to operate because there is no ordinance to regulate them,” Singa said.
Officials of Shilan, municipal employees, and the town police who are members of the task force, implemented the closure order to 10 operators for violating Administrative Order 008-2010 which prohibits the sale, disposal, and storage of chicken dung in the town.
Earlier, the task force found 18 illegal staging areas of chicken dung along the Halsema Highway in Shilan. These 18 staging areas are operated by 10 operators who were given the closure order earlier. 
The operators were given ample time to voluntarily vacate the staging areas, but some were found to be operating during the implementation of the closure order. Also, minutes after the closure order was implemented, one trader continued to operate.
Shilan Punong Barangay Jeffrey Maslag said the barangay passed an ordinance regulating the chicken dung trade, but it did not pass approval of the municipal council upon review because of the AO against the trade.
The barangay ordinance defines the specific site where operators could trade, how many trucks are allowed, and other means to regulate the trade, Maslag said.
He said the chicken dung trade is helpful for the barangay, especially in giving livelihood to residents.
Melecio Orid, one of the long-time operators, said he was just responding to the needs of the farmers as chicken dung is used as a soil conditioner for most farmers.
Orid, who has been conducting chicken dung trade for 26 years, said he is willing to follow the closure order but seeks for the regulation of the trade.
He acknowledged it is hard to unify all the chicken dung operators into following the ordinance, and even with the lobbying of the trade’s regulation.
Singa said while the operators could continue lobbying for the passage of a regulatory ordinance, his office will also study legal remedies against operators who disregarded the closure order.
Last year, the town council recommended to the mayor to close all chicken dung trading, distribution and storage in the municipality based on the AO prohibiting such trade. – Ofelia C. Empian  "
307,Trade Fair Ordinance revisions reviewed,"MARCH 19, 2023","  The Baguio City council has deferred its approval on second reading after publication of the proposed ordinance amending the Trade Fair Ordinance of 1994 to consider more suggestions and recommendations.
The council will also study if a public consultation on the proposal is necessary following concerns on the revisions on some of the provisions of the existing ordinance and to assure it will not violate existing laws.
The proposed amendments, authored by Councilor Isabelo Cosalan Jr., take into consideration the adverse economic situation caused by the Covid-19 pandemic that compelled micro, small, and medium enterprises to promote their products to the public through trade fairs.
It aims to spur such activities in the city to help alleviate the plight of the MSMEs by amending the Trade Fair Ordinance, which was last amended 11 years ago.
Among other provisions, Cosalan seeks to amend Section 2 of the existing ordinance as to allow trade fairs “that promote agricultural, industrial, indigenous, and commercial products, crafts, and other merchandise through inter-regional trading that will foster better livelihood opportunities, enhance local tourism, and help advance economic development for a period not exceeding 15 days in suitable private places and city-owned or managed public parks, including government-owned and controlled properties, roads, and facilities.”
In its session March 13, Councilor Leandro Yangot Jr., who was part of the council that passed the original ordinance in 1995, said there is a need to review and amend it since the situation has changed and there is a need to attune to the call of the times.
However, Councilors Betty Lourdes Tabanda and Mylen Yaranon reminded while it is for livelihood activities, as per existing laws parks and roads are beyond the commerce of man.
“The Civil Code specifically provides that public properties, roads, and facilities are beyond the commerce of man. If we will allow trade fairs in these areas, we will be definitely violating the law. It is violative of the law. Categorically we always say parks and roads are beyond the commerce of man and second, we are a character city, so we have to abide by the law. I don’t think we can come up with an ordinance, which is contrary to law itself,” Tabanda said.
Yaranon asked: “We have been allowing such activities. Whatever happened to the parks are beyond the commerce of man?”
Cosalan explained the proposed revisions aims to provide clarifications and will be based on existing laws.
“We came out with this proposal because truly we are confused. We have allowed trade fairs such as the Session Road in Bloom and Market Encounter. So what is really allowed and not? Why do we allow these activities if indeed by the spirit of the law parks are beyond the commerce of man? So we would like to clarify,” Cosalan said.
Councilor Benny Bomogao said there should be a clear definition of what a trade fair and an exhibition is.
He also seeks to exempt Burnham Park for use for trade fairs, and should only be allowed through a special ordinance allowing such activities in the area.
Bomogao and Yangot offered to submit recommendations to the city council’s committee on market, trade and commerce, which is chaired by Cosalan.
Bomogao also thought the proposal allowing trade fairs, if approved, should be handled by a committee or other concerned city departments instead of the city council to prevent interested parties from approaching councilors asking to be allowed to conduct trade fairs.
Vice Mayor Faustino Olowan said pending action on the proposed amendments, the existing ordinance shall be in effect, as he acknowledged while the general consensus that parks are beyond the commerce of man, the city council had passed ordinances and resolutions allowing trade fairs in parks and roads.
Bomogao said it is time to reflect on the Trade Fair Ordinance and the pending proposed amendments, stressing the existing ordinance should be implemented and strictly followed. – Hanna C. Lacsamana  "
308,CPNP: Maintain culture of peace in LT,"MARCH 19, 2023","  Sustaining the culture of peace that continues to reign in La Trinidad, Benguet will encourage more tourists and investors to expand their business in the capital town, according to Police Director General Rodolfo Azurin, Jr.
A proud son of La Trinidad, Azurin, who served as guest of honor during the 40th Strawberry Festival on March 17, said the municipality has always been a model of peace in this highland region.
He cited the non-practice of employing bodyguards for politicians, which is rare in other parts of the country.
When he was director of the Benguet Police Provincial Office, he recalled deploying police escorts to the late Gov. Nestor Fongwan, Sr. but the latter declined stating that Igorots are not used to seeing a legion of bodyguards for politicians.
The late governor who was also elected representative shared to Azurin that employing bodyguards might cause him to lose the election.
“We take the model of the province of Benguet and we advise our policemen to study the culture of each area kasi iba-iba naman iyong kultura ng bawat area,” Azurin said.
Azurin said the perception of a place is critical for its economy, thus if a place is perceived as peaceful, then tourists and investors will consider the area in their bucket list, or as an expansion site. 
He also urged politicians to come together and set aside their differences, as he cited the recent killing of Negros Oriental Gov. Roel Degamo who was gunned down, along with eight others, in his residence in Pamplona town on March 4.
Azurin said the attack made it in the international news which affects the international community’s perception of the state of the country’s peace and security.
“Everybody wanted to help in the economy of our country because of what happened during the pandemic where businesses shut down and many lost their jobs, so we don’t need these political issues right now,” he said.
He also rallied the Police Regional Office-Cordillera to partner with their respective local government units, civil society organizations, churches, and maintain a good relationship with the community they are serving. 
“We have to keep in mind that whatever is the state of our security in the country, it definitely has an effect on our economy,” he said.
Azurin urged the people of La Trinidad to do their share in promoting peace and order and community resilience, disaster preparedness, and preserving the environment to make the municipality a good place to live in, always thinking about the future generation, drawing from this year’s festival theme, “A festival for recovery: Building a brighter future from adversities.” – Ofelia C.

309,DepEd to build toilets for LGBTQIA+ learners,"MARCH 19, 2023","  A separate toilet to address the hygiene needs of teenage female learners and students who are members of the LGBTQIA+ is being implemented by the Department of Education-Cordillera.
DepEd-CAR Gender and Development Programs head Sasha Joseph Daganos said the initiative is under the “Project Handog (Hygienic and opulent restrooms for girls) para kay Juana sa Cordillera + LGBTQIA”  which aims to build three toilets: Regular toilet for teenage females, another for teenage females to manage their menstrual hygiene, and the third is for the LGBTQIA+ learners.
A member of the LGBTQIA+, Daganos shared in a press conference the initiative was crafted based on the feedback gathered from the schools division offices of the region.
At present, the schools divisions of Ifugao, Benguet and Mountain Province have signified to implement the project with Ifugao having already constructed the three-toilet facility.
The Ubao National High School in Aguinaldo, Ifugao will soon launch the first three-toilet project in the region on March 20.
The regular toilet will have the usual amenities while the menstrual management toilet will have a shower room and another area for the female learners to change their menstrual pads or simply to rest as it will be provided with chairs.
The third room is designed for the LGBTQIA+ learners with one partition to cater to trans males and trans females.
Daganos said the project, specifically the toilet for LGBTQIA+ students, aims to prevent bullying of members of the LGBTQIA+ in schools.
Although there are no grave reports of the cases of bullying against LGBTQIA+ learners, she said there are still cases being reported which they needed to take action.
“We are into inclusivity, kung hindi natin gagawin ngayon kailan pa? We are thankful for the support of DepEd-CAR Director Estela Cariño in not only serving the needs of the boys and girls but also the LGBTQIA+ learners,” Daganos said.
DepEd-CAR is still conducting inventories on the number of students belonging to the LGBTQIA+ to craft more programs to cater to their needs more than the construction of toilets.
On the menstrual hygiene of female learners, Daganos said they are appealing to civil society organizations or private individuals who would like to donate or provide menstrual pads for these learners.
She said many teenage female learners struggle to provide for their own menstrual pads due to its high cost and this sometimes prevents them from going to school.
The construction of toilets is also part of the provision of DepEd for a clean restroom for students, as clean toilets are also a critical part of the learning experience of students.
The DepEd-CAR is hoping to see other schools divisions offices replicating the effort of Ifugao to cater to students’ hygiene needs. – Ofelia C. Empian  "

320,Baguio journo joins media regulation fora in Sweden,"MARCH 19, 2023","  STOCKHOLM, Sweden – A member of the Baguio Midland Courier editorial staff is one of the eight journalists from the Philippines currently undergoing media training here aimed at initiating change towards a more efficient and sustainable planning and implementation of self-regulation of the media.
Midland Assistant Editor Lita Jane Cadalig joined seven other fellows of the International Training Program (ITP) on Media Development in a Democratic Framework Asia 4 in the training held from March 5 to 15 in Sweden’s capital.
The ITP on Media Development, funded by the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency and implemented by NIRAS Sweden, aims to enhance the fellows’ knowledge about media and freedom of expression in relation to media policy and self-regulation of the media sector; extend their professional national and international networks; increase their awareness of human rights, gender equality and security for journalists and other media actors; and increase their knowledge and capacity to initiate a structured long-term transformation work within and outside the respective organizations.
At the end of the training, fellows are expected to initiate projects geared towards the promotion and protection of the institutional frameworks which govern self-regulation of the media.
This is the second year the Philippines is participating in the ITP, which has been implemented in Asia for four years. The other ITP participants in Asia are from Bangladesh, Cambodia, and Vietnam.
To contribute to the development of self-regulatory frameworks for the media, fellows from the Philippines this year have aligned their change initiative to the project implemented by the ITP 2021 team, which is the establishment of media-citizen councils in various parts of the country.
This year’s fellows aim to enhance public awareness over the existing local media-citizen councils and mainstream self-regulatory mechanisms by engaging media stakeholders through dialogues and forums.
With a project title: “Media-Citizens Council: Front & Center, “the Philippine ITP 2022 envisions a media-literate citizenry aware of existing media councils as a self-regulatory mechanism geared towards restoring trust in journalism.
“As the previous ITP Philippines team sustains its efforts in establishing media-citizen councils across the nation, the 2022 team aims to enhance public awareness on the existence of such councils,” the group said.
“By promoting media industry collaboration and securing support from various stakeholders, the team aims to improve the visibility of media-citizen councils and bring them, along with the available self-regulatory mechanisms, closer to the public the media claims to serve.”
The team also noted multisectoral participation in media-citizen councils is essential since the councils’ purpose is to interact with the media audience.
Cadalig, who is also the vice chair of the Kordilyera Media-Citizen Council, was with Catherine Valente of The Manila Times, Janvic Mateo of Philippine Star, Bea Cupin of Rappler, Mia Embalzado-Mateo of the Cebu Citizens Press Council and University of the Philippines Cebu, Arlene Burgos of ABS-CBN News, Paul Soriano of the National Union of Journalists of the Philippines, and Francis Allan L. Angelo of the Iloilo-based Daily Guardian.
Gary Mariano, former chair of the Department of Communication of the De La Salle University, joined the team as its country facilitator. – Press release  "

As known from the City Planning, Development and Sustainability Office (CPDSO), the data was collected when CBMS was piloted in the city in October to December 2021. It was transferred to the national office, and now reverted to usable form by the local government unit.
CBMS is a grassroots and organized technology-based, collection, processing, validating, assessment and diagnostic tool of disaggregated data as to the causes of poverty in the barangay, municipality, city and provincial level. The results are used as bases for economic and social tools, and to formulate poverty alleviation and development programs such as government infrastructure and other projects.    
It is also a gauge for a local government unit’s greater transparency and accountability as to resource allocation or budgeting, CPDSO head Donna Tabangin said.   
Data is culled from the following aspects: health, nutrition, housing, water and sanitation, education, income, employment, peace and order, animal and agricultural data, infrastructure and gender.
A provision in the agreement states that information from individuals and households are confidential and covered by the Data Privacy Act of 2021 and other laws.
A training for data protection officers, local government unit officials and stakeholders is scheduled on March 23 and 24 and will focus on local CBMS database management, data privacy measures, data sharing protocols, and use and operation of the CBMS databank.    
The raining is a part of the final implementation of the CBMS program in the city. – Julie G. Fianza  "
324,4 recognized as Outstanding Women Leaders of Baguio ‘23,"MARCH 19, 2023","OUTSTANDING WOMEN LEADERS — The city government of Baguio recognized four Outstanding Women Leaders as part of the celebration of Women’s Month on March 16. This year’s OWLs are Annie Marie Caguioa, for education; Maria Monica Costales, for human resource management; Editha SemillaPuddoc, for public administration/community peace building; and Marites Baucas, for community women empowerment. — Hanna Lacsamana  Four residents of Baguio have been added to the city’s growing list of Outstanding Women Leaders.
As part of the celebration of Women’s Month, the city government has recognized four women leaders who excelled in the fields of public administration and community peace building, community women empowerment, human resource management, and education.
Editha Semilla Puddoc is the awardee for public administration and community peace building. She has been a resident since 1988 and works as a director at the National Police Commission-Cordillera.
Under her leadership, Napolcom-CAR has ensured the region’s police force continues to increase its engagement with the Philippine Commission on Women to improve gender mainstreaming among their ranks.
In 2018, the commission partnered with the OWLs and University of the Cordilleras, organizing the Women’s Forum on Crime Prevention and Gender Awareness and Development.
This led to the organization of the Sangguniang Kabataan Youth Summit which helped cascade information on combating illegal drugs, violence against women and children, and social factors affecting general health.
Marites Baucas has been chosen as an OWL for her contribution in community women empowerment.
A resident of Baguio for 33 years, Baucas was first employed as a laborer at Hangar market, worked as a farmer in Buguias, Benguet, her hometown.
In 2000, she was a community participant, became a committee member and later a member of the Board of Directors of the Balacbac Multipurpose Cooperative.
In 2012, she was elected president of the Sto. Tomas Proper Women’s Association and contributed in the development of the women’s social life and economic productivity that led to the establishment of a bakery that promoted and sold their products, becoming their source of income.
She became an OWL in the eyes of her community, women, and partners for contributing to the welfare of women members, indigent families, victims of abuse, youth, and children.
Maria Monica Costales, who has lived in the city for 55 years, is the OWL for human resource management.
As an educator at the Philippine Military Academy, she was every student’s champion who values education and advocates students’ welfare from 1997 to 2020, helping around 3,500 PMA graduates.
Her services as an educator and researcher have been extended to the entire Armed Forces of the Philippines.
She has also been organizing Baguio balik-eskwela projects distributing school supplies, and with her colleagues, she has been actively donating to projects for social causes.
Since becoming an educator in the 1990’s, Costales has been committed in purchasing school supplies and donating them in Baguio and neighboring communities using her personal resources.
Annie Marie Caguioa, OWLs awardee in the field of education, has been a resident of the city for 41 years. A teacher by profession, she rose from ranks as classroom adviser to assistant school director of St. Louis School.
Caguioa was also consulted by the city council of Baguio on the implementation of the Solo Parent Act to help single parents, especially women, ensure the welfare of their children. She empowered the parents and teachers association and alumni association of their school by giving financial assistance for the tuition of children with solo parents.
She also created the learners’ financial assistance that benefited around 350 learners in the school during the Covid-19 pandemic where most parents lost their job and cannot sustain the education of their children.
The OWLs 2023 awardees were feted on March 16 at the PFVR Gym led by its president Dona Digna Rosario and city officials led by Vice Mayor Faustino Olowan, Rep. Mark Go represented by wife Sol, and Philippine Information Agency-CAR Director Helen R. Tibaldo who was the guest of honor and speaker. – Hanna C. Lacsamana  "
325,The Baguio Museum elects new officers,"MARCH 19, 2023","U.S. Ambassador H. E. Sung Y Kim during the “soft launching”  of the Cordillera Gallery last July 19, 2019 as guest of honor and speaker.  With the culmination of the United States Embassy’s 2017 Ambassador’s Fund for Cultural Preservation (AFCP) project, the Baguio Museum is bracing for more aggressive projects in the next five years.
And it is calling on supporters to help this non-profit institution which was built in 1975, inaugurated in 1977 and destroyed by the earthquake in 1990 then rebuilt again in 2001.
The soft launching of the Cordillera Gallery was done in July 2019, prior the pandemic and was honored with the presence of U.S. Ambassador His Excellency Sung Y. Kim who started the 2017 AFCP project.
The Baguio Museum won a selective contest in the Philippines together with 30 other museums all over the world.
As for the grand relaunching in September 2022, U.S. Ambassador Her Excellency Mary Kay Carlson graced the event. The pandemic closed the museum temporarily for seven months starting in March 2020. The rehabilitation and beautification of its galleries continued in September 2020 after stringent protocol requirements for the carpenters were complied with. The project ended in June 2021.
The 30-month project grant from the U.S. Embassy in Manila was extended for 15 months as a result of the pandemic closure of all constructions and other unforeseen events. The Baguio Museum partially open to limited visitors in October 2021. By January of 2022, its doors opened to visitors after almost two years with strict protocols.
The grant implemented the following goals: Capability building training for the staff of the Baguio Museum and the small museums in Northern Luzon; Conservation/restoration and re inventory of its artifacts; and the infrastructure rehabilitation of its interior galleries from the 1st floor to the 4th. While in the process of rehabilitation, a strong typhoon hit Baguio damaging the roof. Conservation and restoration of artifacts had to be redone.
However, the U.S. Embassy came to its aid again. The project team consisted of the project director, Project Assistant Director Gemma Gardingan Estolas, Conservator-consultant Orlando Abinion, Curator consultant – Bettina Arriola and Project Architect Michael John Astudillo.
It also invited culture bearers to guide in the set-up of new exhibits. Towards the conclusion of the project, the U.S. Embassy had a reorganization in 2021, Grants Officer Representative Edwin “Boyet” Vergara, who generously helped the team was replaced by Floribel “Pong” Aureus and GO Matt Keener was replaced by Pauline Anderson.The pandemic also deterred the consultants from coming up because of travel restrictions. Hence, now that it has been completed, bigger programs and projects are planned for the coming years by a very enthused Board of Trustees.
First on the agenda, was the election of a new set of officers. This was done last March 4. The board intends to make this community museum digitalized and to be the first stop for tourists to visit before any tour is conducted.
Elected officers were: Peter Ng as president, Helen Tibaldo as vice president, Ryan Mangusan as secretary and Kristine Bautisa Sameon as treasurer.
The board is composed of capable and outstanding leaders representing a cross section of the community such as the academe, business, bankers, environmentalist, media, the indigenous and foreign communities, tourism oriented establishments like restaurants, artists, and the local government unit. The other members of the Board of Trustees are Edilberto Tenefrancia, Edna Anton, Nicolas Tabora (ex-officio), Fred Bagbagen (ex-officio), Felipe Puzon, Kidlat Tahimik, Sheree Nolasco and Stella de Guia (executive director). Gemma Estolas is the museum assistant curator.
With the support of the Board of Trustee and with limited budget, the Baguio Museum produced a “Virtual Turo-Tour-uan Series” during the pandemic to keep people interested and aware of the museum, beginning with Benguet province.
It was posted on YouTube. It shouted a clear message that culture and heritage is very much alive. Artists have started to exhibit their works in 2022. The museum was also able to produce its brochures finally funded by the Fernando and Rosa Bautista Foundation thru its trustee Kristine Sameon.
Meanwhile, trustee Kidlat Tahimik mounted his trial installations at the Baguio Museum and the Sunshine Park prior his monumental exhibit at the Palacio Cristal del Retiro in Madrid, Spain in October 2021, called “‘Magellan, Marilyn, Mickey and Fray Damaso: 500 Years of Rock Star Conquerors.”  This epic exhibit was visited by about half a million tourist in six months. The National Museum of Anthropology invited Tahimik’s exhibit and the installations. Some of the installations are at the FDCP Building and the Museong Pambata.
Ng has brought Chinese Consul Yang Zerui of the Consulate of the People’s Republic of China and the Filipino-Chinese community to the Museum in November 2022.
President of SM Supermalls Steven Tan gave a financial assistance to the museum’s “digitization” project for the purchase of “state of the art” laptops which were used to train selected High School and College students so they could use and reecho their knowledge to their particular schools and institutions. On top of these programs, the Baguio Museum also reached out to indigent patients and students with the help of partners SM Baguio and the Baguio General Hospital Advisory Board. Aggressive plans are on the pipeline, like marketing in the form of flyers and standees, to hotels, schools, taxi drivers and operators. Collaboration projects are underway with focus on training programs.
Training of affiliates like the Dosent committee volunteers and friends of the Museum volunteers are also going to be implemented.
Donors will be encouraged to help continue the museum’s “Digitization” project and acquisition of interactive equipment. The rehabilitation of its parking lots, painting of its roof and landscaping are also being targeted.
Ng is keen on improving the techo projects of the museum while Tibaldo would pursue an intensive marketing campaign.  "
326,Revisiting the Mirador Heritage & Eco-Spirituality Park after two years,"MARCH 19, 2023","The Peace Memorial has a majestic view of the Western Philippine Sea on a clear day.  It is no wonder why the weekend traffic at Lourdes Grotto in Dominican-Mirador, Baguio City has caused residents much discomfort, as the Mirador Heritage & Eco-Spirituality Park is a continuing work in progress. Compared to 2021, when the former Jesuit Villa inaugurated the Mirador Peace Memorial, it has become a tourist destination for varied visual, physical, and spiritual experiences.
When the Japanese Torii was installed in 2021, the traditional Japanese Shinto gate that marks the transition from the mundane to the sacred became a social media hit. Following the curiosity of many locals, we were awed by this one landmark on the property apart from the Lady of Lourdes image of the Virgin Mary that had continuously drawn many lowlanders to climb in some sort of penitence the 252 steps up the hill to the grotto once in their lives for many decades.
The Catholic devotion to Christ’s Mother Mary combined with the Japanese belief that spiritual powers exist should have shaken some purists’ religiosity into opposition, but it has convinced many that spirituality can be experienced deliberately or for now, expressed in the millions of photographs on Facebook and Instagram. From then till a few days ago, the elements of Japanese landscaping using different textures of stones instead of cement on surfaces has transformed what used to be jagged hillsides into gentle meandering paths connecting six adventures for a token P100 for non-residents and half the price for the locals.
Apart from the five mysteries of the rosary that mark the paths, there is the La Storta garden named after the vision of St Ignatius at the Chapel of La Storta near Rome in Italy. The three white circular symbols are used as seats in a small niche along the walk. The Peace Memorial with the bell and the Torii, is along a connecting path that is now leveled and surrounded by gentle stairs and steps that look out to the China sea on clear days or some of the 128 villages or barangays that make up the city and the province of La Union on foggy ones. There is access for wheelchairs in many parts of the park. On the same side of the hill, there is the Blue Moon Gate that is from Chinese traditional architecture that is a garden opening for pedestrians.
The path that continues to skirt the property on the left has the Pandemic Healing Memorial that leads to the Holy Family Gardens where prayers and petitions can walk side by side with each step. This leads to the multi-tiered walkway to the Founders’ Garden where sculptures made by famous artists give you more photo ops for selfies and the upper rock gardens with more reason to stop and rest along the way. The Arashiyama bamboo grove has become denser and provides the ecological highlight to the otherwise limestone dominated landscape. This then leads you out of the property and ends a delightful promenade.
But unknown to many, the Jesuits were hosts to the weather monitoring instruments early in the 20th century and once housed the earthquake monitoring equipment prior to the 1990 earthquake.
A structure is maintained as a memorial to the former Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology station.
But the Bahay Lourdes has been repaired and now houses Café Iñigo of Ebai’s Café. This used to be where the Philippine Long Distance and Telephone Company opened a long-distance service office when long-distance operators were in vogue. Back then, the Internet was still imagined, but the need to communicate locally or internationally was urgent and it was here where the analog phones until the 1980s served the locals. But this is where a different kind of thin crust pizza can be had without having to pay the entrance fee. This is where you can wait comfortably for the tourists and try the Margarita pizza with sliced tomatoes and lots of cheese or the Sagada pizza that features the smoked ham or kini-ing from that part of the Cordillera.
The slices of sweet tomatoes make this a different snack compared to the commercial counterparts. Brewed coffee should keep you warm while you wait at the café. There are other snacks and meals available before or after the tour.
There is always a reason to go back to this Mirador destination. The happiness and spiritual renewal are take- home bonus sentiments to a worth it stroll.  "

The partnership was announced during the International Women’s Day (IWD) celebration last March 8. Anchored on the IWD theme “DigitALL: Innovation and technology for all,” the celebration was focused on advancing the visibility, participation, inclusion, and rights of women in the fields of digital, technology, and innovation. The announcement was made by Connected Women founder and head of Special Projects Gina Romero, UN Women’s WeEmpowerAsia Philippines Country Program Manager Rosalyn Mesina, SM Supermalls President Steven Tan, and Aboitiz Equity Ventures (AEV) First Vice President and Chief Reputation and Sustainability Officer Ginggay Hontiveros, who was represented by Aboitiz Foundation, Inc. (AFI) Assistant Vice President Danny Cerence, AFI Manager Jowelle Ann Cruz together with AEV Assistant Vice President for Media Relations Maricar Bautista. As technology continues to revolutionize how society lives, works, and connects, it is important for women to have the skills, knowledge, and opportunities to participate and thrive in today’s digital world. Women beneficiaries will be trained in Artificial Intelligence and Data Annotation (AIDA) through Connected Women’s award-winning Elevate AIDA program. With their market-aligned skills, these women will have access to long-term, flexible work and livelihood opportunities. “Through our partnership with Aboitiz and SM SuperMoms, our shared membership of 340,000 women will be empowered in the future of work. This is a crucial step towards building a more innovative and sustainable workforce for the Philippines’ digital future,” Romero said. Between the partners exists synergies based on the shared belief about the power of technology to bridge the gender gap and empower women. “Empowering women through technology is not just about providing skills and income, it’s about advancing their vital and rightful position in the digital world. With AI and data annotation training, Filipino women will be empowered to navigate the changing nature of work and contribute to the growth of the economy. Let’s finally bridge the gender gap in tech and create more opportunities for women to thrive and succeed, not just for themselves, but for the entire nation,” said Hontiveros said. Filipino women have historically been disadvantaged in work and economic opportunities due to family commitments and a lack of flexible job opportunities. The Elevate AIDA training program was launched in 2020, in partnership with UN Women, providing tech upskilling opportunities to women during the height of the pandemic. It has been recognized by the UN Women’s Empowerment Principles (WEP) Awards for championing opportunities for women. As of December 2022, Connected Women has trained over 55,000 women with the support of like-minded partners, including Aboitiz Group business units namely Aboitiz Power Corporation and Union Bank of the Philippines. Also working with Aboitiz Data Innovation, Connected Women is empowering their members to take on advanced services such as data handling, language annotation, and image annotation for ADI’s Data Science and Artificial intelligence projects. – Press release  "

332,BSP board mandates full adoption of QR PH codes,"MARCH 12, 2023","   The Monetary Board of the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas has approved the guidelines that will facilitate the full transition of all quick response (QR) code-enabled payments services to the national QR code standard or “QR Ph.” The guidelines mandate BSP-supervised financial institutions (BSFIs) acting as payment service providers (PSPs) and offering QR code-enabled payment services to use and display QR Ph on their Internet and mobile channels starting July 1. The PSPs, including those participating in the InstaPay automated clearing house, are required to submit the status of their compliance with the QR Ph standard within 30 days from the date of the memorandum. “With the active development of the industry in this space, it is timely for the BSP to ensure that QR-enabled payments are supported through the interoperable QR Ph standard. This way, PSPs and their clients would be able to fully realize the benefits brought by the convenience, speed, and ease of using QR Ph,” said Governor Felipe M. Medalla. The QR Ph standard is currently adopted for two high-impact use cases in the country, namely person-to-person and person-to-merchant payments. These transactions form the bulk of the average total retail payments made by Filipinos in a month. “Standardizing QR codes enhances customer and merchant experience, leading to greater usage of digital payments,” Deputy Governor Mamerto E. Tangonan added. The guidelines were issued via a memorandum that provides for the transition of non-QR Ph codes for electronic payments services to the QR Ph standard before July 1. Thereafter, non-QR Ph codes or proprietary QR codes shall be disabled and shall no longer be available to the public. PSPs are also reminded to provide appropriate product training and guidance on the features of QR Ph to their employees, including store cashiers and managers. The memorandum implements BSP Circular 1055 on the “Adoption of the National Quick Response Code Standard” issued in October 2019. Circular 1055 requires BSFIs that serve as PSPs to adopt the national QR code standard in their payment services. This is aimed at transforming the fragmented QR-driven payment services into interoperable payment solutions, eliminating the need for merchants and customers to maintain several accounts and display numerous QR codes. – Press release  "
333,DTI pushes strategies to boost creative industries,"MARCH 12, 2023","   Challenges in the creative industries need to be addressed for the development of the local sector and to determine the contribution of the sector to the economy, according to Trade and Industry  Sec. Alfredo Pascual. In the recent opening of the 2nd Philippine Creative Industries Summit, Pascual identified the strategies to address the bottlenecks in the creative industries through the Malikhaing Pinoy or Creative Philippines campaign. “Malikhaing Pinoy is our holistic approach to addressing the constraints and barriers to growth of the creative industries. It is a flagship initiative well-informed by the various sector-specific industry studies and roadmaps carried out by the DTI with support from our champions from Congress,” Pascual said. He said studies in the creative industries’ sub-sectors will be conducted and statistical data shall be gathered, particularly the actual contribution of the creative industries in terms of employment, trade and gross domestic product. “To allow us to measure the creative industries’ economic contributions accurately, we will continue working with the Philippine Statistics Authority and the Intellectual Property Office of the Philippines to establish a well-defined and reliable statistical system through the Creative Industries Satellite Account,” he added. Pascual also encouraged stakeholders to submit roadmap proposals for sub-sectors such as architecture and landscapes, eSports, fashion and textile, furniture and fixtures, gifts, decors, housewares, graphic design and jewelry. He is also pushing for improving access to capital for the creative industries. “We will establish the Creative Venture Fund, consistent with the goals of PCIDA (Philippine Creative Industries Development Act), and shall be used to co-finance the business expansion of creative enterprises and individuals. In addition to this venture fund, financial support in the form of grants and soft loans is also being planned,” he added. To equip local talents with skills and competencies in complex new technologies and their application in creative processes, Pascual said the DTI aims to build the Ensayo Creative Hub, which will be a learning academy and will serve as co-working space for creative professionals and aspiring creatives to collaborate with their ideas and business development. “Through the hub, we will implement a series of creative capability building programs focusing on animation and game development. We will offer courses on starting an animation and game development business, marketing and management, partnerships and international opportunities,” he said. – PNA  "

335,Bigger flower  fest in 2024 eyed,"MARCH 12, 2023","   City Administrator Bonifacio dela Peña congratulated the Baguio Flower Festival Foundation, Inc. (BFFFI) on the successful conduct of the just concluded Panagbenga. In Monday’s flag-raising rites at City Hall, dela Peña said participation to the activities of the month-long event was successful and Baguio is looking forward to an even larger celebration next year. “This year’s Panagbenga festival started well and also ended very, very well,” dela Peña said. He said although the city’s projection of 1.5 million visitors to this year’s festival was not met, the annual extravaganza’s return is “already a good start” since it has helped in hastening the recovery of hotels and other accommodation establishments that were among the most affected by the pandemic. As for the local economy as a whole, he said Mayor Benjamin Magalong is expecting its full recovery in about five years spearheaded by tourism since it is one of Baguio’s top industries. “Rest assured that we in the city government are doing all we can in hopefully achieving the full recovery of our economy in less than five years,” dela Peña said. – Gaby B.

336,Women,"MARCH 12, 2023","  (Editors’ note: The Midland Courier is reprinting the columns of the late Atty. Benedicto T. Carantes as a tribute to one of its long-time columnists. This piece was published on March 15, 2015.) Once upon a time all that the women wanted was to be granted the right of suffrage, marching and holding hands together to show unity of purpose.
When the privilege of the right to vote and to be voted upon was extended to their gender, that marked the beginning of more marches to come; marching for many other worthy causes, and more than anything, the seeming inequality between men and women that favors the men in near discrimination against the women. Today the women want to take over from the men, who apparently lost all moral right to lead, concerned with more personal gain and power, practically neglecting the rest of their fellowmen.
This is practically true in the Philippines, where the men have greatly contributed to the ruin of the nation, and now it is up to the women to put the country back together – slowly but surely falling apart – before it is too late.
Whether the women will be up to the task remains to be seen, but maybe it is time for the women to show what they are capable of. Hopefully, it won’t be jumping from the frying pan into the fire.
We pray not. As per biblical yore, it was Eve, the first woman, who struck a deal with the devil disguised as a serpent, and later on, using feminine wile (disguised as love and affection), convinced Adam to partake of the forbidden apple, and that was how we lost paradise. Who is to blame? The devil, the fruit, Eve, or the weakling Adam? But following the theory of evolution, men evolved from the ape, and ribs had nothing to do with the creation of women.
But wait up, biologically, men and women are different in form and body, and procreation requires that the men be on top. Here again, the women are reversing positions, not really for the pleasure of the act, but for the thrill of it, so the men will know who is the real boss. Cunning versus gullibility, targeting macho men who do not know any better. Whatever, in nearly everything – politics, business, sports, education – the women are about to dethrone the men. Serves them right for erroneously thinking that they are better than the women, good only for making babies and taking care of household chores. But on second thought, isn’t that the whole point?
Alas, today’s women are turning things around, and that the word husband should be changed to “houseband”. Anyway, let’s just keep our fingers crossed, and see what the women can do once they take charge.  "

338,Int’l Day of Women deals w/ gender gap in technology,"MARCH 12, 2023","  Every girl has a right to be connected and play a part in shaping a more equal, green, and tech-driven future and there is a need to demand for the creation of more technologies that are friendly to women. The Cordillera Regional Gender and Development Council (RGAD) has launched the region’s observance of March as the International Women’s Day and Month as part of the global effort to inform and engage women and everyone to push for gender sensitive and responsive government programs and services that empower women to contribute to nation-building. In line with the year’s international theme “DigitALL: Innovation and Technology for Gender Equality” and “WE (Women and Everyone) for Gender and Equality and Inclusive Society” of the Philippine Commission on Women, Social Welfare and Development Regional Director and RGAD Chair Leo Quintilla said the celebration aims to inform and engage women and everyone to push for gender-sensitive and responsive government programs and services that empower them and to provide a platform to share good practices to further strengthen the Magna Carta for Women towards its milestone 15th year in 2024. It also aims to call for their empowerment towards maximizing their benefit from innovation and technology by bridging the gap in information and communication technology (ICT) and connectivity, their inclusion and other marginalized groups in technology for more creative solutions and greater opportunities for gender equality and meeting women’s needs. “We have to demand, we have to create more technologies that are friendly to women. If we go to farming communities, for example, most technologies were designed for men. It’s time to develop technologies that will be more gender-friendly,” Quintilla said during the event’s launch, March 6. He added this is also a celebration of women and girls who are championing the advancement of transformative technology in digital education and highlights the importance of protecting the rights of women and girls in digital space and addressing online and ICT-facilitated gender-based violence. Dr. Ferdinand Gonzales, RGADC co-chair and Regional Development Council-CAR private sector representative, noted ICTs had been invaluable during the Covid-19 pandemic which helped people to stay connected and keep vital services and businesses going. But he said there is still a “striking digital divide” between the educated middle class in the cities and the rural-based populations in the current ICT landscape in the Philippines and an observed gender disparity when it comes to access to ICT for productive use, as traditional Filipino families, especially in the rural areas, remain “very patriarchal” and consider ICT and other science and technology, engineering and mathematics fields in general as a form of productive endeavor as more appropriate fields for male members of the family. As a result, ICT is likely to become more accessible through education to the Filipino males, he said. “In this era of remote learning, when girls lack access to affordable Internet and to a computer or tablet, it means there is (someone) being left behind,” he said. The National Telecommunications Union of the United Nations reported in 2019 the digital gender gap is growing fast in developing countries and Internet usage keeps growing but this is hindered by lack of ICT skills and expensive Internet use and broadband. “For every girl, the goal must be meaningful connectivity. Broadband that is reliable, fast and regularly available, along with access to digital technologies and universal digital literacy. We will also aim to see to better response to women and girls’ most pressing needs and ensure we do not reinforce gender stereotypes that prevent many girls from pursuing studies in ICT fields,” Gonzales said, pointing out that the jobs of the future will be driven by technology and innovation, and women must be at the forefront of this transformation. He also quoted the UN which said in some parts of the world, the gender gap is growing, reinforcing gender inequalities by denying women and girls opportunities, access to education, find better pay-jobs, and start new businesses. “Making these technologies available to all is an essential part of building back stronger communities and economies and addressing many of the world’s most pressing challenges,” he said. He added ICT matters for gender equality for opportunity, since the Internet is a great enabler, creating unprecedented opportunities for female entrepreneurs to enter global markets and boost small businesses’ growth by establishing international level playing field that enables all businesses regardless of size, location, and sector to compete on an equal footing in global markets. It also provides women capacity in terms of access to basic needs such as healthcare and education; as well as understanding by improving efficiency, enhancing coordination, and improving the quality of information gathered and shared for development planning. “Today and everyday we recognize digital power must be in the hands of everyone, especially among the women and girls. We have a unique window and momentum now, to secure bold commitments that will ensure girls are connected and empowered to create a brighter future the world needs. Let’s work and celebrate in creating a space where there is access, equity, and participation that promotes gender among women, men, boys and girls in every society,” Gonzales said. RDC chairman and Apayao Gov. Elias Bulut Jr. added gender equality is not just a women’s issue but also a human rights issue that affects everyone. He said there is a need to acknowledge there are still significant challenges to achieving gender equality and inclusivity as women and girls continue to face discrimination, harassment, and violence both in the workplace and in their personal lives. “These are serious issues that we must address head-on through a combination of policies, programs, and cultural change. We must also recognize the progress that we made, especially in the Cordillera, where women are breaking down barriers in fields that were once male-dominated and are making significant contributions to our economy. But the road ahead is long and winding, so we must not waver and continue to advocate for policies and programs that promote gender equality and inclusivity and ensure they are effectively implemented,” Bulut said. – Hanna C.
