1,‘Titling of Burnham Park needs approval of DOT’,2023-05-07,"Even when granted full control over Burnham Park, there are limitations to what the city government of Baguio can do over the park.
One of these is segregating portions of the park.
The Presidential proclamations that granted the city government full control and administration of Burnham Park prohibit segregating a portion of the park unless permitted by the Secretary of the Department of Tourism.
This was revealed amidst the Tourism Infrastructure and Development Authority’s protest about the city government’s titling of portions of the park.
Titling of city land needs started during the term of former mayor Mauricio Domogan but the former mayor clarified that in the case of Burnham Park, only a relocation survey was pursued to determine its exact metes and bounds, not to have it titled.
Domogan told reporters he did not see the need to have the park titled as it is already delineated as a park by virtue of a Presidential proclamation.
He recalled there was a previous attempt by a group of Ibaloys to have the Ibaloy Heritage Garden titled but he disapproved this, saying the national government, through the Department of Tourism, is still the owner of Burnham Park.
He said Executive Order 224 signed by then President Fidel Ramos which devolved management of the park from the National Parks Development Corporation to the City of Baguio and EO 695 signed by then President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo, which gave the city full control and administration of the park, has specifically set the limitations of the city government.
“The proclamations were for the transfer of administration only. Kasla nga LGU (local government unit) ti management arm ti Philippine Tourism Authority (now Tieza),” Domogan said. 
He added the titling of portions of the Burnham might set a dangerous precedent as this will allow for other entities to also apply for titling over areas covered by presidential proclamations.
The issuance of title also gives leeway for the city government to exercise its right as owner.
“As owner, the city can do whatever it wants such as to sell or mortgage,” the former mayor said.
On April 24, the city council has allotted an additional P2 million for the titling of Lot 6, which covers portions of the swimming pool and Pine Trees of the World.
City Administrator Bonifacio dela Peña earlier said the city government will apply for all areas in Burnham Park that are not covered by OCT 1. Portions of Burnham Park covered by OCT 1 include the Athletic Bowl and the lots where the old city library and old auditorium were located. 
City officials justified the titling saying this will allow the city government to “clear the irregularities” happening including illegal occupation, adding that the city government does not intend to remove the jurisdiction of the Tieza over the area.
Recently titled portions referred to as Burnham Lot 1 are the picnic grove, skating rink, the parking area fronting Tiong San Harrison, City Environment and Parks Management extension office, City Library, Burnham Lake, Children’s Playground, Orchidarium, bicycle area, Rose Garden, Melvin Jones grandstand, food stalls, Igorot Garden, and Ibaloy Heritage Garden. – Rimaliza A.

2,Bar owners discuss issues w/ City Hall authorities,2023-05-07,"The creation of an adjudication board headed by the City Legal Office has been proposed to look over issues concerning bar and entertainment business owners and City Hall offices that are in charge of regulatory documents.
The conduct of meetings may also be initiated to thresh out concerns on permits/licenses or on the acquisition process or procedures.
These were among the things agreed on during a dialogue between bar and entertainment business owners and representatives from the Public Order and Safety Division (POSD), City Health Services, City Legal, City Planning, Development and Sustainability, and other concerned offices last week.
Among those discussed are the city’s smoke-free program where POSD Chief Daryl Longid said the provisions are clear and are enough as bases for confiscation or issuance of a notice of violation.
Longid said during inspection of establishments, details and evidence of smoking are scrutinized before an action is done.
Applications for smoking areas are accepted, but Longid warned that requirements are stringent; and fenced, wide, but unroofed areas for smoking are compulsory.
The liquor ban remains and proposals for its amendment are still with the city council, Longid added.
He also reminded bars and business owners of the Silent Night Ordinance, where excessive loud noise/music are prohibited from 10 p.m. to 5 a.m. and from establishments within 200 meters from schools, churches, and hospitals. Penalties are set at P1,000; P3,000; P5000 on first, second, and third offense, respectively, with six months imprisonment, or both.       
Entertainment or bar operating hours are up to midnight, while those with dancing are up to 2 a.m., but winding-up hours should be done earlier.
Longid said permits for the line of business should be visible as his staff could be called up to check on said business establishments at any hour.
He said the POSD is open for dialogues and clarifications as discussions lead to a healthy relationship between authorities and business people. – Julie G. Fianza

The Baguio City Police Office (BCPO) reported the city was peaceful and orderly after it hosted crowd-drawing events recently.
Baguio City hosted the three-day Cordillera Administrative Region Athletic Meet 2023 and Regional Academic Festival, Ifugao Day celebration, and the 121st Labor Day Job Fair from April 27 to May 1.
BCPO Information Officer Angeline Dongpaen said the police force first raised their alert status and conducted Regional Simultaneous Anti-Criminality Law Enforcement Operations (Sacleo) from April 24 to 30 to tighten and strengthen security and ensure the overall safety of more than 5,000 athletes from the Cordillera.
Dongpaen said about P6.7 million worth of illegal drugs was seized and 25 lawbreakers were arrested by the BCPO in the 35 police operations conducted during the week-long Sacleo, which commenced midnight of April 24.

6,Street performers of Baguio OK plans to regulate practice,2023-05-07,"Street performers composed of buskers, cosplayers, and pantomime artists agree that their operations should be regulated by the government in order to make their performances a pleasant experience for the performers themselves and their audience.
In the public consultation concerning the proposed ordinance that sought to regulate performan-ces in public areas last May 4, the stakeholders accepted the proposal for the payment of an annual permit fee of P350.
The amount will be deposited in a trust account, which, at the end of every year will be used for the benefit of registered street performers.
Only bona fide residents of Baguio, La Trinidad, Itogon, Sablan, Tuba, and Tublay will be issued permits. Proponent Councilor Leandro Yangot Jr. said street performers who are not from the Blisst may be allowed to perform in Baguio during the proposed busking festival, which is being eyed to be held October of every year.
The proposal has also addressed the involvement of minors. In the consultation, it was agreed that only those who 18 years old and above will be allowed to perform.
Other proposed measures to regulate street performances include, prior registration with the City Tourism Office, display of permit to perform, performances shall be at designated areas and on a specific time only.
The proposal states that performances will be allowed from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m., but City Tourism Officer Aloysius Mapalo said the schedule of performances may be extended until midnight on special occasions such as Christmas in Baguio orPanagbenga.
For establishments that hire street performers, Mapalo said their performance should be limited within the confines of the establishment and should not extend to public areas adjacent to the establishment.
The proposal prohibits collection of money from the public as payment for their performances, but allows acceptance of tips, which is voluntary, Yangot said.
A Street Performance Committee (SPC), tasked to screen the performers, designate areas where performers may perform, review the content of the performances, ensure order in areas where street performers are designated, measure the prescribed ambient noise level of musical instruments and loud speakers, which is limited to 10 decibels, and monitor compliance to the guidelines will be formed once the ordinance is approved.
The SPC will be chaired by the mayor, co-chaired by the city administrator with the City Treasurer, head of the Permits and Licensing Division, city tourism officer, city council chair of the committee on tourism, and two representatives from accredited street performers groups as members.
The proposal also states that the mayor may suspend a permit for not more than 30 days if the performer has provided false information in their registration form or if the performer has been charged with three administrative complaints within one year.
Permits may also be revoked if a performer ignores summonses for five consecutive instances. 
In the interim, the CTO has been implementing a scheduling system for street performers at Session Road. This is following the assessment made by the Local Finance Committee of the need for the city government to regulate street performers so as to prevent crowding at the city’s main thoroughfare.
At the time of assessment, micro and small enterprises were permitted to sell at Session Road every Sunday.
Mapalo said the regulation is meant to balance what the city has to offer as a Unesco Creative City for folk arts and crafts and manage the type of activities and performances done in public places.
Yangot said once the proposal is approved, all street performers will be required to register, including those who perform at private functions and in private venues.
Street performers, regardless of the area where they ope-rate will be required to pay a permit fee, as the ordinance does not cover only those at Session Road.
The proposal, which will contain the inputs gathered from the public consultation will be discussed by the city council, prior to its approval. – Rimaliza A. Opiña

They do not need to pay it back, the DSWD will just monitor how they use the P10,000.
Gatchalian committed the support of the DSWD and the national government.
It is the directive of President Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos to prioritize the provision of assistance to victims of disasters and calamities especially to those who need it most.
“Nandito po ang DSWD kasi ang bilin nga po ng Presidente sa atin, kung may mga ganitong klaseng sakuna, lalo na sa mga maliliit nating negosyante katulad nyo, importante na nakakatulong ang gobyerno na makabangon kayong muli.”

1,"CEO: 1,200 properties encroached on RROW",2023-04-30,"Around 1,200 property owners in the city have been found encroaching road rights-of-way (RROW).
The finding was reported based on the ongoing RROW recovery program of the city government that has so far mapped an estimated 40 percent of the Baguio’s 128 barangays.
In a media forum on April 26, Engr. Januario Borillo, chief of the City Engineering Office’s Traffic and Transportation Management Division, said more or less 37,000 square meters of RROW have been encroached at present.
He said his office, in coordination with the City Treasury Office (CTO), plans to do a mapping project that would specify individual owners whose structures have occupied RROWs.
The number of square meters of RROW these structures have occupied will then be determined and the appropriate rent may be charged the erring lot owners, Borillo said.
“These rentals could be a source of additional revenue for the city government that will be allocated to support its ongoing RROW recovery program, which has a limited budget,” he said.
Borillo added a problem possibly faced by some of those applying for building permits is that they may not know that their structures have already encroached on RROW.
“In this matter, our office can help them by mapping the barangays where these owners can see whether their structures have gone out of their property lines or not. This is where the RROW recovery program can help them,” he said. 
The RROW recovery program primarily aims to help ease the city’s traffic situation along major thoroughfares and ensure these are compliant to the standard width. – Gaby B. Keith

3,Police to taxi drivers: Dashcams important,2023-04-30,"Following the robbery of a taxi driver in Baguio City by two male suspects, the Baguio City Police Office reminds drivers to have dash cameras installed in their vehicles.
BCPO Abanao Police Station commander Maj. Lee Alvin Alinao, in an interview with PTV-Cordillera, said taxi drivers and operators should make sure that their dashcams are working properly.
The incident, which happened at 3 a.m. of April 26 in front of the University of the Cordilleras gate 5, was caught in the dashcam of the taxi.  
The suspects, wearing face masks and baseball caps, boarded along Marcos Highway and told the driver to bring them to the night market at Harrison Road. 
But upon reaching the ill-lighted area along Harrison Road, the suspects announced a holdup where one of the suspects placed a knife around the victim’s neck.
It could be seen and heard from the footage of the dashcam the driver was pleading for the suspects to get his earnings for the day, but spare his life as he has a family to come home to. 
In the police report, it stated the victim grabbed the suspect’s hand holding the knife to remove it from his neck. Taking his chance, he dashed out of the taxi and ran towards Burnham Park where he reported to the tourist police unit in the area.
Police personnel immediately conducted a search for the area which led to the arrest of the suspects who were found at Burnham Park.
The 17-year-old suspect was committed to the City Social Welfare and Development Office Bahay Pag-asa for being a minor, while the 19-year-old suspect was brought to the Baguio City Jail. They are facing a case of attempted robbery with violence.
The 33-year-old victim sustained lacerations in his neck and right wrist and was discharged from the hospital in stable condition.
Alinao said the incident is the first robbing incident for a taxi driver to be reported this year. He advised taxi drivers to take extra precaution when on duty especially on the wee hours of the morning. – Ofelia C. Empian

4,P5 M allocation for Kennon tourist area dev’t approved,2023-04-30,"The city council has approved the allocation of P5 million as the city government’s counterpart to the development of a tourist rest area along Kennon Road.
The approval came with the condition that the agreement between the Department of Environment and Natural Resources and Mayor Benjamin Magalong that involves the city’s payment of lease to the DENR will be submitted for ratification.
The city council earlier sought a clarification on the agreement in which the city government is being asked to lease from the DENR the area identified as tourist rest site along Kennon Road.
The allocation of P5M for the site development at Kennon was identified as a priority project and is part of the supplemental budget earlier submitted for council approval, but was then deferred pending an explanation on the lease contract.
City Planning, Development, and Sustainability Office head Donna Tabangin told the council the original plan was for the DENR and the city government sign a memorandum of agreement to share the profits that will be derived from the area where a structure that will accommodate a souvenir shop, cafe, and toilets, including parking, will be constructed using the P9M grant from the Tourism Infrastructure and Enterprise Zone Authority (Tieza).
Tabangin said when the MOA was forwarded to the DENR central office, the former asked the city to instead lease the property for P220,000 annually. The DENR owns the 1,500-square meter area.
She said the city will engage a third party to operate the tourism rest area and pay a monthly rent of P800 per square meter.
Asked by Councilor Benny Bomogao how much the city government is projected to earn from subleasing the property, Tabangin said on the first year, the income from a lease of P800 per square meter would be P1,267,000.
“If the city spends for the maintenance of the building, the net profit on the first year would be P446,700,” she said.
Councilor Jose Molintas asked if the city government could instead request from the DENR the free use of the property, but City Administrator Bonifacio dela Peña said the mayor already negotiated with the DENR to lower the lease to P220,000 yearly.
“The DENR asked for a lease of P2.2M yearly, but the mayor negotiated and was able to lower it to P220,000 annually or P22,000 monthly,” he said.
Department of Tourism-Cordillera Legal Officer Brenden Quintos said the agency is waiting for the finalization of the agreement between Baguio and DENR before it can proceed with the issuance of documents for the P9M grant to be released by Tieza. – Jane B. Cadalig

5,"With sporadic rains, city sounds off dengue alert",2023-04-30,"Mayor Benjamin Magalong advised residents to be on guard against dengue fever this early as the city experiences intermittent rains especially in the afternoons.
The mayor said dengue has been a serious health concern as every year, cases rise during rainy seasons experienced from June to October.
“But as we are now experiencing sporadic rains, we need to observe preventive measures like ridding our surroundings of mosquito breeding places to make sure that dengue-carrying mosquitoes will not thrive,” the mayor said.
The City Health Services Office has always advised residents on practicing the 4S strategy: search and destroy mosquito breeding places; self-protection measures (use window screens, mosquito nets, wear protective clothing, use insect repellents); seek early consultation; and say no to indiscriminate fogging.
“Walang dengue kung walang lamok. Walang lamok kung walang breeding places. Walang breeding places kung malinis ang kapaligiran. Ugaliing mag-search and destroy at gawin nang sabay-sabay upang siguradong mawalan ng breeding places ang mga dengue-carrying mosquitoes,” advised Dr. Donnabel Panes, head of the City Epidemiology Surveillance Unit of the CHSO.
Engr. Charles Carame of the CHSO Sanitation Division said the CHSO’s dengue strategy follows the Prevent-Detect-Isolate-Treatment-Reintegration (PDITR) model: 
Prevent through the 4S strategy;
Detect through rapid testing and conduct of larval surveillance where samples of kiti-kiti are studied to predict an impending outbreak;
Isolate through a campaign for dengue-infected individuals to protect themselves from being bitten;
Treatment through an aggressive case reporting system and provision of dengue wards and fast lanes in hospitals; and
Reintegration through the sustained conduct of the strategies with the fact that dengue immunity does not cover all strains as a motivation. – Aileen P. Refuerzo

The city government of Baguio launched an Art Bank, a first in the Unesco Creative City of Crafts and Folk Arts.
The Art Bank, located at the Baguio Athletic Bowl, is a creative space that shall serve as a depository for the works of local artists and open to the public for viewing.
It was officially opened on April 25 with a ribbon-cutting ceremony led by Councilor Leonardo Yangot, Jr. and graced by Mayor Benjamin Magalong.
Yangot urged local artists to exhibit their artworks in the art bank.
“Artists can store their creations, especially during this rainy season, so that many will see and be interested in purchasing local artists’ artwork when the peak season comes,” he said.
The art bank, which will be expanded to the Sports Office once it is moved to its new building, will highlight the works of local artists and help people understand the value of art and culture for inclusive growth, according to Magalong. – Alpha May U. Patacsil

7,Rules set on busking at CBD,2023-04-30,"The city government of Baguio will resume the conduct of Session Road Sunday Pedestrianization on May 7 after setting guidelines to address issues about buskers or street performers.
The city government suspended the Sunday promenades at Session Road after the Panagbenga Festival, giving back the main thoroughfare to motorists due to complaints against buskers and complaints from the buskers themselves.
Issues raised include the lack of guidelines on selling and/or merchants abusing their privilege; products sold are not different from market those sold in the market; crowding due to the unregulated operation of buskers; agents making busking a business; busking outside of Session Road and on weekdays; use of animals in busking; mendicants posing as buskers; harassment of buskers by promenaders and vice versa; and unregulated solicitations.
The City Tourism Office serving as the secretariat and overseer of the Session Road Sunday Pedestrianization activity proposed the following guidelines, which were immediately adopted by city executives during a management committee meeting held April 25.
Only buskers accredited by the City Tourism Office will be allowed at Session Road.
Requests for registration will be subject to curation and validation. Strictly, no ID, no busking.
Up to 150 buskers (number can vary as approved) are allowed on one given Sunday. Buskers shall be allowed only during their assigned schedules. All buskers scheduled on a given Sunday shall be assigned an area, moving out from assigned area/s is not allowed. Shared areas must be to some extent, equally divided.
Specially-abled buskers may be exempted from rotation on schedules and areas, as long as registered and endorsed by Persons with Disability Affairs Office. – PIO

9,Student leaders decry military’s intimidation,2023-04-30,"The student council of the University of the Philippines Baguio called on city officials to denounce the alleged surveillance, harassment, and intimidation by military units on students and their families.
Student council officers Iya Trinidad, Angelika Joven, and Kendree Almero sought an audience with the Baguio City Council last April 17. 
Trinidad said five UPB students had been victims of surveillance, harassment, and intimidation by Task Group Baguio in a span of five months. She said these students had been visited by members of Task Group Baguio in their homes and had been accused as “potential recruits” of communist groups.
Almero called these acts “untimely, undemocratic, and unnecessary.” He appealed to the city council to call out and condemn such acts.
Councilor and Sangguniang Kabataan Federation President Levy Lloyd Orcales said during the public consultations regarding the proposed Youth Development Code of Baguio City, a number of students from different universities shared the same experience. 
Orcales said it was the fourth time that student leaders had reached out to the city council to express their recurrent concern with law enforcement agencies.
Councilor Mylen Yaranon said the city council will push for legislation protecting students and other individuals against red-tagging and police/military harassment. 
Incidentally, on the same day, the city council approved on first reading a proposed ordinance establishing a mechanism that protects the rights and fundamental freedom of human rights defenders in the city. 
On April 19, human rights defenders and members of various advocacy groups in the city trooped to the multipurpose hall of the Baguio City Hall to attend the public consultation facilitated by Councilor Jose Molintas. 
The consultation tackled the proposal of the Baguio City Police Office to give incentives to informants of members of communist groups. It also tackled red-tagging incidents in the city including the symposia or fora conducted by uniformed personnel in various schools in the city where various organizations were linked to communist groups and videos containing violent scenes were reportedly shown. 
Participants of the consultation, some of them claimed to have been red-tagged, denounced the vilification of student leaders and human rights defenders by state forces. 
They also opposed the proposed reward system for tipsters as this may result in a “witch hunt.”
They also condemned the conduct of forums in schools where legitimate organizations were branded as belonging to terrorist groups.
They called on the city council to enact legislation that would uphold academic freedom and would guarantee the protection of the youth from police and military intimidation.
Task Group Baguio Commander Cristopher Sab-it said the forums which they conducted in schools were part of their information-education campaign against insurgency in the country. He denied showing graphic videos and pictures during these forums.
Sab-it said he is open for dialogues with the advocacy groups and broached a joint information-education campaign with them. 
Lawyer Joecle Dongla of the CHR-Cordillera said 34 cases of red-tagging were filed before the CHR from 2018 to 2023. Of the number, 18 were dismissed, 13 were resolved with findings on human rights violations, and four are still pending. 
Earlier this year, an advocacy group called Justice and Peace Network in the Cordillera also called on the city council to craft guidelines on banning red-tagging and political vilification.
The group’s appeal was prompted by an incident at Session Road where a policeman allegedly harassed 14 of its members during a chalk art activity on Dec. 4, 2022. According to the group, the police officer allegedly linked their solidarity messages to terrorism.
Molintas said red-tagging is divisive and impinges on the right to free speech. – Jordan G. Habbiling

11,City gets aggressive in anti-squatting campaign,2023-04-30,"The city government will halt ongoing constructions in residential and forest reservations that are not covered by building permits as it adopted a more aggressive stance against squatting and violators of the National Building Code and environment laws.
Mayor Benjamin Magalong who ordered an intensified campaign against ongoing illegal structures last March 3 formed a core group called the Baguio Anti-Squatting and Illegal Structures (Basis) to conduct inspections and identify and stop structural developments not covered by the necessary permits.
The Basis is composed of personnel from the City Buildings and Architecture Office, City Environment and Parks Management Office, City Legal Office, City Engineering Office and deputized environment officers of the Baguio City Police Office.
Since the mayor issued the order, BCPO City Director Col. Francis Bulwayan Jr. included the monitoring of ongoing constructions in residential, commercial and forest areas in regular patrol activities of the different police stations.
Those not covered by permits were reported to the CBAO for verification and issuance of notices of violation and cease and desist orders.
As a result of the inspections, an ongoing residential building construction at GEFA barangay was issued a cease and desist order with the owner advised against pursuing further construction activities and to secure building permit. The owner was likewise directed to clean and clear all construction materials and debris obstructing the sidewalk immediately and to enclose the construction site with green G.I sheets pursuant to Executive Order 17, s. 2020.
An ongoing construction of a rooftop enclosure at Roman Ayson, Campo Filipino was also slapped similar orders for having no permit.
In Outlook Drive, four ongoing structural developments (two ongoing building constructions, one extension and one digging of foundation) were found without building permits posted at the construction sites in Purok 2 and Purok 4.
The BCPO endorsed its findings to the CBAO for verification and issuance of notices of violation of the Building Code.
Three ongoing large constructions at Navy Base, St. Joseph Village were also issued cease and desist orders. – Jessa Samidan and Aileen Refuerzo

12,Councilors back titling some portions of Burnham Park,2023-04-30,"Several members of the Baguio City Council lauded the initiative of the executive department to title portions of Burnham Park in the name of the city government of Baguio.
Councilor Jose Molintas said having a title over Burnham Park will allow the city government to “clear the irregularities” happening therein including illegal occupation, adding that the city government does not intend to remove the jurisdiction of the Tourism Infrastructure and Enterprise Zone Authority (Tieza) over the area.
During the regular session last April 24, the city council approved the proposed additional fund in the amount of P2 million for the titling of other portions in Burnham Park and other areas in the city that are being used by the city government. 
The recently titled portions are referred to as Burnham Lot 1 with a total area of 182,045 square meters. This lot covers the picnic grove, skating rink, the parking area fronting Tiong San Harrison, City Environment and Parks Management extension office, City Library, Burnham Lake, Children’s Playground, Orchidarium, bicycle area, Rose Garden, Melvin Jones Grandstand, food stalls, Igorot Garden, and Ibaloy Park.
The title, called Original Certificate of Title 2023000017, was issued on March 3.
After acquiring a title for Burnham Lot 1, the city government is now pursuing the titling of Burnham Park Lot 6 which covers portions of the public swimming pool, and Lions Club and Pine Trees of the World with an area of 10,021 square meters. However, City Planning and Development Officer Donna Tabangin said the Department of Environment and Natural Resources had returned the titling application of the city government for Lot 6 due to some issues with its adjacent lots.
City Administrator Bonifacio dela Peña said the city government will apply for all areas in Burnham Park that are not covered by Original Certificate Title 1.
With an area of 299,083 square meters, OCT 1 is under the Insular Government and is managed by the DENR. Portions of Burnham Park covered by OCT 1 include the Athletic Bowl and the lots where the old city library and old auditorium were located. 
These land titling initiatives were started by former mayor Mauricio Domogan and are being completed by the current administration.
Burnham Park is a historic urban park in the city covered by Proclamation 64, s. 1925, which established the Burnham Park reservation for park purposes.
The city government has been the administrator of Burnham Park since Feb. 10, 1995 pursuant to Executive Order 244 issued by then President Fidel Ramos. Prior to this, the park was under the Philippine Tourism Authority. The full control and further development of the same was finally transferred to the city government on Jan. 10, 2008 when then President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo issued Executive Order 695.
Department of Tourism Legal Officer Brenden Quintos said Tieza, during a meeting last March 29, questioned the move of the city government to have Burnham Park titled in its name and that Tieza wants to retain ownership of Burnham Park. 
Dela Peña said the city government will have a dialogue with Tieza to iron out the issue on titling.
Councilor Mylen Yaranon earlier questioned the plan to title portions of Burnham Park in the name of the city government. She asked whether a presidential proclamation can be canceled by the issuance of a land title.
She said OCT 1 was also questioned during the term of her late father, then Mayor Braulio Yaranon.
General Services Officer Eugene Buyucan, whose office is tasked to process the titling, said OCT 1 which was issued in 1910 does not supersede Proclamation 64 since the former precedes the latter.
He added acquisition of a title does not cancel Proclamation 64 as the proclamation identifies the use of an area while a title indicates who owns it. – Jordan G. Habbiling

13,Leader airs side on issues hounding Ifugao Day in city,2023-04-30,"An Ifugao group leader refuted the claims made by another group who appeared before the city council earlier to seek the latter’s help in settling their differences.
Raul Ballogan, founder and National President of the Intermingling of Ifugao Body and Brotherhood Association, Inc. (IIBBA), has asked Ifugao residents in Baguio not to be sidetracked by the issues that tend to divide, instead of unifying them.
Ballogan reached out to the Midland Courier to air his side and clarify some of the claims made by Ifugao Brethren (FIB) headed by David Dumangeng at the city council and which was published in the paper in its April 23, 2023 issue.
The two groups could not settle their differences on the celebration of the Ifugao Day, which was set on April 29.
Dumangeng’s group asked the city council to help them settle their differences, especially on the use of the Ibaloy Heritage Garden as venue for the Ifugao Day and eventually for the groups to unite and conduct their events as one group.
Ballogan said he was for unity, which is the very reason he worked hard to form a group that would unite the Ifugaos residing in Baguio.
This is also why he gave up his reservation of the Ibaloy Garden and opted to have his group hold their version of the Ifugao Day at the Igorot Garden so the FIB can use the area and prevent aggravating the problem.
Ballogan said it is not true that he evaded invitations by the FIB for them to sit together and settle their concerns and talk about uniting.
“I sent my representatives to the meetings they initiated because I want to make it clear that when we meet, we will talk about uniting our groups, but that is not what they are discussing during meetings,” Ballogan said.
He said he is willing that the two groups merge and promote the interest of all the Ifugaos in Baguio, not just the personal interests of the officers.
The IIBBA and FIB used to be one group, but Ballogan said during the times he went to Banaue, Ifugao to seek an elective post, Dumangeng’s group elected new officers, in violation of the by-laws about the qualifications of officers.
He said Dumangeng became president of the group by virtue of succession when the elected head resigned from her post due to criticisms by members and officers of IIBBA chapters who said she was not qualified to become a federation president.
Ballogan said what’s happening with the Ifugao groups now is unfortunate, considering that his intention in forming the group was to unite all the Ifugaos.
“I worked hard to organize the Ifugaos residing in Baguio in 2004, because I wanted to replicate the unity of the people from Mountain Province who are always ready to help their provincemates who are in need or get together for fellowship,” he said.
He added he wants the Ifugaos in Baguio to be united and also look after each other and work together to promote and protect their culture.
The IIBBA and FIB staged the Ifugao Day on separate venues.
Earlier, the city council tasked the committee on indigenous peoples chaired by Councilor Maximo Hilario Edwin, Jr., to sit down with the groups and help them resolve their differences.
The councilor asked the two groups to settle their differences so that they can hold the Ifugao Day as one group. – Jane B. Cadalig

14,Human rights defenders ordinance in city pushed,2023-04-30,"Amid various complaints related to red-tagging, threats, and harassment, the city council committee on laws and human rights has filed a proposed ordinance establishing protective mechanisms for human rights defenders in the city.
The city council approved the proposed ordinance on first reading last April 17 during its regular session.
According to Councilor Peter Fianza, chairperson of the committee, human rights defenders and progressive groups in the city have experienced human rights violations such as political vilification, unfounded red-tagging and terrorist-labeling, harassment, and intimidation.
He said these incidents had been reported to the city government and Commission on Human Rights.
Fianza said activists and human rights groups in the city such as the Cordillera Youth Center, Tongtongan ti Umili, Youth Act Now Against Tyranny Baguio-Benguet, and Cordillera Human Rights Alliance have been seeking redress and lobbying to the city council since 2018 for policies and programs protecting and promoting human rights in the city. 
The proposed ordinance seeks to protect human rights defenders in the city while awaiting the enactment of a human rights defenders’ law. 
“Baguio City commits itself as a safe space for everyone, nurturing vibrant democracy and good governance,” Fianza said.
The ordinance, once enacted, shall declare the rights and freedom of human rights defenders in the city. 
These rights and freedom are the right to promote and protect human rights and fundamental freedoms; right to form groups, associations, and organizations; right to solicit, receive, and use resources; right to seek, receive, and disseminate information; right to develop and advocate for human rights ideas; right to communicate with non-governmental, governmental, and intergovernmental organizations;
Right against vilification; right to access, communicate, and cooperate with international and regional human rights bodies and mechanisms; right to participate in public affairs; right to peaceful assembly; right to represent and advocate; right to privacy; freedom from intimidation or reprisal; right to seek or establish a sanctuary for human rights violation victims and their families; and
Freedom from defamation and stigmatization; right to exercise cultural rights and development of personality; and right to effective remedy and full reparation.
The ordinance shall also impose the obligations of public authorities in protecting human rights defenders in the city. 
These obligations include providing free access and promote materials related to human rights and fundamental freedoms; securing the non-disclosure of the sources used by human rights defenders; preventing human rights violations and ensuring protection from intimidation or reprisal; penalizing intimidation or reprisal;  desisting from derogatory and unfounded labeling; ensuring protection from arbitrary or unlawful intrusion and interference; not participating in violating human rights and fundamental freedoms; assisting in investigation; adopting human rights based governance; and promoting advocacies related to human rights.
The protective mechanisms for human rights defenders under the ordinance have four components. 
The first component is the coordination and cooperation among the city government and CHR-Baguio field office, and civil society organizations for the streamlining of human rights education and investigation of complaints on human rights violations.
The second component is the establishment of a sanctuary for high risk human rights defenders, human rights violation victims, and their families. 
The third component is the provision of psychosocial assistance for high risk human rights defenders, human rights violation victims, and their families.
The fourth component is the campaign against derogatory and unfounded labeling.
Under the ordinance, freedom parks shall be identified. These declared freedom parks may be used for peaceful assemblies.
The ordinance also contains provisions on community-based campaigns on human rights and human rights defenders; integration of activities under this ordinance into the City Development Plan and Local Youth Development Plan; and commemoration and memorialization of human rights defenders and human rights violation victims. – Jordan G.

1,2 Ifugao groups seek council help in settling differences,2023-04-23,"Here’s a case of two groups representing indigenous peoples from one province asking the city council to help them settle their differences.
Two organizations representing the Ifugaos living in Baguio City have sought the council’s intervention so they could settle their differences on who should lead the Ifugao Day celebration in the city on April 29.
The council invited the Federation of Ifugao Brethren (FIB) headed by David Dumangeng and the Intermingling of Ifugao Body and Brotherhood Association (IIBBA) led by Raul Ballogan, to clarify why the two groups are separately celebrating the Ifugao Day celebration.
Dumangeng said it is unfortunate and shameful for them to be asking the council’s help on a trivial matter, but they were hoping it was the best way to settle their differences.
The celebration on April 29 is by virtue of a 2019 city council resolution that designated the second Saturday of April as Ifugao Day celebration in Baguio to be held at the Ibaloy Heritage Garden at Burnham Park.
Both organizations have requested the use of the Ibaloy Garden, but Ballogan, in a letter, said his group, the IIBBA found another venue where they could hold the program separately from the FIB.
Dumangeng told the council they have met several times to hopefully resolve their differences and agree on having only one celebration in one venue, to no avail.
“It may be a shame on us, elders, but it is our hope that with your help, the all the Ifugaos in Baguio will come together and celebrate the Ifugao Day as one,” Dumangeng said.
The councilors said the best people who could settle the matter are the members of the two groups themselves.
CouncilorsVladimir Cayabas and Arthur Allad-iw said the council could only advise them to resolve their differences.
“Remember that you are privileged to have been designated a day where you can celebrate here in Baguio. Not all groups from the different provinces living in the city are given a day to showcase their culture,” Cayabas said.
Councilor Peter Fianza said it is unfortunate the Ifugao groups that helped resolved the issues of the Ibaloys on who should be the rightful indigenous peoples mandatory representative are now the ones being divided.
“Settle this matter among yourself. If you were able to do it for the Ibaloys, why not do it for yourselves,” Fianza told the FIB and IIBBA representatives.
Councilor Isabelo Cosalan, Jr. asked the groups if they were amenable to move the celebration of the Ifugao Day instead to Sept. 2 to coincide with the celebration of the Victory Day that commemorates the victory of Filipino soldiers that fought along the Americans to liberate the country from the Japanese.
Cosalan said this would give time for the two groups to resolve their issues, but the groups said they wish to pursue the April 29 celebration this year and consider the suggestion later on.
The city council committee on indigenous peoples chaired by Councilor Maximo Hilario Edwin, Jr., was tasked to sit down with the groups and help them resolve their differences. – Jane B. Cadalig

3,"Stipend for college students in Baguio increased to P10,000",2023-04-23,"Students in Baguio who are qualified under the city government college financial assistance program will receive higher stipend every semester.
The city council has approved the amendment to the College Education Financial Assistance Grant Program that increased to P10,000 from P6,000 the allowance given to qualified beneficiaries.
Upon the recommendation of the committee on appropriations and finance cluster A, the council approved the allocation of P20 million annually for the program to be included in the budget of the City Social Welfare and Development Office (Cswdo).
In 2020, the program was allotted P10 million.
The steering committee was also reconstituted to include representatives from the city mayor’s office; vice mayor’s office; the council committee chair on social services, women, and the urban poor; the Commission on Higher Education, Technical Education and Skills Development Authority; and school representatives.
Under the amended implementing rules and regulations, students enrolled in universities outside Baguio may qualify for the financial assistance provided that they are enrolled in a state university and college and in private higher educational institution that offers courses, which are not available in universities in Baguio.
They should also include the curriculum checklist in their application.
Grantees will receive a maximum number of their assistance based on their curriculum checklist in which those who are enrolled in technical/vocational courses good for seven to 10 months will receive one payout while those enrolled in tech/voc courses good for 11 months to two years will receive two payouts.
Those enrolled in a four-year course will have a maximum of eight payouts and those taking a five-year course will get a maximum of 10 payouts and 12 payouts for students enrolled in a six-year course.
Scholars who want to shift to other courses will continue enjoying the benefit provided they submit a certification that 80 percent of their subjects are credited.
They should also undergo counseling with a social worker.
Grantees who fail to meet the requirements without updating the city government for two semesters will be dropped from the program.
Those who incurred failing grades may be retained in the following semester provided they only failed a maximum of two subjects and will pay at their own expense should they decide to enroll for the short term.
Students who incurred failing grades in the succeeding semester will no longer qualify for the financial assistance.
Those who are having their on-the-job training and having their research subjects can still claim their financial assistance if they incur an incomplete grade, provided that they pass those subjects at the end of the school year.
The financial assistance program is meant to help underprivileged but deserving students who are residents of Baguio. – Jane B. Cadalig

4,"City planing to setup public crematorium, columbarium",2023-04-23,"The city government targets to construct a public crematorium and columbarium within the cemetery compound to expand the capacity of the already overcrowded public burial ground.
This is part of the plan to redevelop the public cemetery and transform its presently congested and disorderly state into a modern, aesthetically designed and structured final resting place.
The plan was prepared by the City Environment and Parks Management Office in response to Mayor Benjamin Magalong’s call for the rehabilitation of the city cemetery.
In the project proposal submitted by Cepmo Department Head Rhenan Diwas as prepared by Public Services Officer III Arturo Killip, the necessity of providing crematory and columbarium services was stressed noting that these have now been an accepted alternative to the common way of disposal and treatment of the human remains.
“As more dead people are buried in the cemetery, orderliness, aesthetics and public comfort were given less importance. Despite the setback, the city government must accommodate requests for burial spaces and for this reason, the cemetery today is disorderly. It was only in 2012 that there was a tenancy period of five years. Thus this proposal aims to control the allocation, arrangement and tomb construction that should put orderliness in the already congested city cemetery,” the proposal read.
Apart from the crematorium and columbarium proposals, other recommendations made for the redevelopment were the installation of apartment/condominium type niches, reclaiming of the areas occupied by informal settlers and developing a new cemetery site.
Implementation will be subject to procedures spelled out in the project proposal, foremost the creation of a technical working group to formulate the redevelopment concepts and plans, enactment of an ordinance, formulation of the master plan, selection of a development concept before the final implementation.
The city cemetery, which started operations in 1932, has an approximate land area of 9.16 hectares with only 58 percent available as burial site.
A study said the carrying capacity of the cemetery is about 10,000 burial lots to make it safe, comfortable and aesthetically appreciative. However, the 2011 survey showed there were already 19,725 burials done.
Despite this status, burials continue to be done out of necessity subject to remedial measures adopted by the department.
The Cepmo said the city government is aware that cemetery is an amenity that it should provide thus the fees and rentals imposed are way below from that of the private cemeteries, to wit: burial fee – P500; lot rental – P100 for five years; exhumation fee – P300; condominium tomb: lower and top levels – P12,000; and middle tombs – P15,000.
On the other hand, the average cost of gravesite plot at memorial parks is P70,000 and the average cremation cost is P25,000.
According to Cepmo records, there are other cemeteries and memorial parks in the city which are either privately managed, managed by the barangay, or managed by a clan: Everlasting Memorial Park, Pyramid Memorial Park, Paradise Garden, and Kias Cemetery, all in Kias barangay, The Sanctuary in Heaven’s Garden – Loakan Proper,  Baguio Memorial Park – Naguilian Road, Ambiong cemetery, Bakakeng  cncestral cemetery, Loakan cemetery, Benin cemetery at Pinsao Proper, Sadanga cemetery at Ambiong, Baguio City Veteran’s Cemetery, Loakan Road.
Crematoriums are Pyramid Memorial Park Crematorium, Beyond the Sunset, and Sanctuary in Heaven’s Garden. – Aileen P. Refuerzo

9,59 percent of male dorm PDLS are drug offenders,2023-04-23,"Fifty-nine percent of the residents of the Baguio City Jail-Male Dorm are drug offenders.
Jail Superintendent April Rose W. Ayangwa, warden of the Baguio City Jail-Male Dorm, said 216 out of the 376 persons deprived of liberty are drug offenders.           
She attributed this to the dedication of the Philippine National Police and the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency in their sustained implementation of the government’s enhanced anti-illegal drug campaign.       
Ayangwa said following drug cases on top of the list of PDLs is rape, which accounts for 10.16 percent.        
She said the facility continues to implement programs such as therapeutic community modality program, Katatagan, Kalusugan at Damayan sa Komunidad, alternative learning system, drug symposia and lectures on the ill effects of illegal drugs, outpatient drug treatment and rehabilitation program by the Baguio General Hospital and Medical Center, and other development opportunities in line with the government’s program on the whole-of-agency approach to eradicate illegal drugs in the country and the Buhay ay Ingatan Droga’y Ayawan advocacy program of the Department of the Interior and Local government.
On the data of PDLs with special needs, Ayangwa said there are 26 Muslim residents, 14 members of the LGBTQIA+ community, 10 senior citizens, eight diabetic patients, and four tuberculosis patients.        
She said the PDLs had already been separate and have their own dorms inside the male dorm and that their needs are being addressed by the jail personnel on duty.        
Ayangwa said regular treatment and monitoring of all PDLs under medication for tuberculosis, hypertension, psyche, and other related concerns are being administered by health personnel.        
She said the male dorm will continue to provide various training skills for the development of the PDLs as part of the vision of the Bureau of Jail Management and Penology as an agency capable of being highly efficient in providing humane safekeeping and developmental opportunities to PDLs.            
At the start of the quarter, the male dorm has coordinated with the Technical Education and Skills Development Authority and other service providers where the facility manages skills training such as tile setting, dressmaking, rattan weaving, and bayong-making.           
Ayangwa said through these trainings, the PDLs were able to produce exceptional products which the public can check in the facility’s official Facebook page or they can directly visit the facility for orders.            
She added the increase in livelihood programs presents income-generating activities to PDLs during their confinement where they are able to earn for their personal upkeep and for financial support to their families. – PIO release

11,Congestion rate at Baguio City Jail posts improvement,2023-04-23,"The congestion rate of male dorm of the Baguio City Jail has improved to 138 percent in April this year compared to the 162 percent congestion rate in the same period last year.    
Jail Superintendent April Rose W. Ayangwa, warden of the Baguio City Jail Male Dorm, said as of April 17, the facility had a population of 365 persons deprived of liberty who are distributed in 27 rooms within the 1,295-square meter floor area of the jail.            
She said with an area of 1,540 square meters, the Baguio City Jail Male Dorm is one of the congested jails in the Cordillera based on the standards of the United Nations where the space for each PDL is 4.7 square meters.       
Ayangwa said the decrease in the facility’s congestion rate was made possible with the diligent efforts of the courts of law where 371 PDLs were released from January to December last year out of the 404 PDLs that were committed for detention.       
She said there are 400 PDLs detained in the facility when she assumed office in January 2023 and from January to April 16 this year, a total of 180 offenders were released while 116 were committed for detention.           
She said the courts are doing all interventions to help in decongesting the jail to ensure it will be compliant with the UN standards.
Ayangwa assured stakeholders the Baguio City Jail Male Dorm will be able to provide more developmental opportunities to the PDLs to prepare them for their reintegration to society.           
She said the proposed construction of the Baguio City Jail male and female dorms at Barangay San Luis village covering an area of 3,750 square meters pursuant to a deed of usufruct between the city government and Bureau of Jail Management and Penology is yet to be included in the agency’s 2024 budget.          
She expressed the BJMP’s gratitude to the city government for the support in the proposed construction of the building to address the facility’s congestion. – PIO release

12,CBCP joins call for gov’t to declare climate emergency,2023-04-23,"The social arm of the Catholic Bishops’ Conference of the Philippines (CBCP) has joined the call for the government to declare a climate emergency.
Fr. Antonio Labiao, Caritas Philippines executive secretary, said they call on the government to take action on how to address the effects of climate change.
“We are calling for a swift transition to a low-carbon economy, the protection of natural habitats and ecosystems, the adoption of just, pro-people, and sustainable economic development practices across all sectors,” Labiao said in a statement issued in line with the celebration of Earth Day on April 22.
“We invite everyone to join us calling out our leaders and to raise our voices for the dignity of our common home and for our future generations,” the Catholic priest added.
The appeal was also supported by the CBCP-Episcopal Commission on Health Care and CBCP-Office on Women, Council of the Laity of the Philippines, social action centers of dioceses and vicariates, Caritas offices, and Catholic schools.
Different climate advocates on April 21 marched to the Mendiola Peace Arch and asked President Ferdinand R. Marcos, Jr. to declare a climate emergency.
The groups claimed with climate change becoming increasingly evident through extreme weather events, sea-level rise, and the loss of biodiversity, there is an urgency to act on the ongoing climate crisis.
“We are declaring that we are now in a state of climate emergency and we commit to do sustained and bold actions to help slow down environmental deterioration, with sustained regenerative actions to restore ecological balance,” said Yolanda Esguerra, member of the Rights of Nature (RoN) PH Steering Committee.
The groups also called on the government to “take the lead in fulfilling its mandate to protect the well-being of both nature and people, ensuring that a clear and comprehensive plan containing strategic and urgent actions is put in place to address climate change impacts.”
“All citizens should take action. Climate change is becoming an existential issue globally. Pope Francis calls on all peoples to an ecological conversion. Immediate actions to address the climate emergency should be our utmost concern,” said John Din of Columban Missionaries and National Coordinator of Laudato Si Movement.
The RoN PH with other civil society groups initiated the Citizen’s Declaration of Climate Emergency, a year-long campaign to mobilize Filipinos in addressing climate crisis, highlighting the responsibility and accountability of government leaders and duty bearers to respond to the crisis but also doing their share to protect the environment. – PNA

1,Illegal structures within Teachers Camp removed,2023-04-16,"The City Demolition Team and City Anti-Squatting and Illegal Structures (Basis) demolished on April 13 three structures built within the Teachers’ Camp reservation without the requisite building permit and consent to construct.The City Buildings and Architecture Office through the City Demolition Team led by Engr. Donald Gas-ib implemented Demolition Order 4, s. 2022 issued by Mayor Benjamin Magalong based on the complaints of the National Housing Authority.The NHA is the administrator of Proclamation 613, s. 2004 which segregated and reserved 3.4 hectares of land within the Teachers’ Camp reservation for housing site purposes and for disposition to qualified beneficiaries.The issue dates back in 2016 when NHA Region 1 and Cordillera Manager Eduardo G. Leano requested the CBAO for the immediate inspection and issuance of demolition order to an ongoing construction within the proposed/identified access road of Proclamation 613.Records of the Project Interagency Committee (PIAC) of the NHA show notices of violation have been issued to the owner of the structure for them to stop their ongoing construction.Considering the investigation was conducted several years back, the Anti-Squatting and Anti-Illegal Structures Committee requested the CBAO to conduct re-investigation on the structures within the proclamation to have an updated report as to the identity of the owners and the dimension of the structures and materials used.On Oct. 19, 2021, the CBAO submitted a memorandum containing the result of the re-investigation revealing 11 structures within Proclamation 613 of NHA while the rest of the structures are within Proclamation 290 under the jurisdiction of the Department of Education particularly Teachers’ Camp Administration.Four structures within Proclamation 613 are the priority concern of NHA described as follows:One-story residential structure made of reinforced concrete, concrete hollow block and galvanized iron sheets with approximate measurements of eight by eight meters in footprint area, allegedly constructed sometime in 2012;One unit comfort room made of wood, concrete hollow block and galvanized iron sheet with approximate measurements of 2.5m by 1.5m in footprint area, allegedly constructed sometime in 2016;An unfinished one-story residential house made of reinforced concrete with approximate measurements of 9m by 6m in footprint area; andOne-story shanty made of wood and galvanized iron sheet with approximate dimension of 5m by 3m footprint area, allegedly constructed sometime in 2010.Per certification issued by CBAO dated Oct. 18, 2021, no building permit was issued to the owners of the structures resulting in the issuance of notices of violation and the committee reiterated voluntary demolition.However, only the owner of the shanty voluntarily demolished their structure as of December 2021.On Dec. 2, 2021, one of the respondents requested the NHA if it is possible for the government to sell to the former that portion of the lot that they have occupied.But the representatives of NHA answered in the negative since this would be a direct violation of Republic Act 7279 or the Urban Development Housing Act of 1992.Also under the Policy Guidelines on Beneficiary Selection and Disposition of Homelots adopted by the PIAC, all the three structure owners are not actual occupants within the Baguio Teachers Camp reservation.The city government will implement an aggressive operation for the demolition of illegal structures within reservations as well as stoppage of ongoing constructions without building permits. – Jessa Mardy P.

2,BWD’s interconnection project augments supply,2023-04-16,"UP AND RUNNING — The Baguio Water District technical team rendered overtime on Holy Thursday to complete the testing of the pipeline interconnection of the BWD Malvar tank and Old Lucban barrel. The interconnection project aims to augment water supply towards the Buyog and Pinsao-2 deepwells due to the seasonal decline of water sources during the dry season. — Mark Victor Pasagoy
The Baguio Water District has completed the pipeline interconnection project at the Old Lucban deepwell on April 6.The project, initiated on April 4, aims to augment the reduced water yield of the Buyog and Pinsao-2 deepwells.Problem areas in parts of Pinget, Pinsao, Fairview, Magsaysay, Quirino Hill, and Tam-awan are expected to have better water supply during water diversion schedules.Primarily, water will be sourced from the Malvar deepwell and will be conveyed to augment the Old Lucban deepwell.Earlier this year, BWD has been closely monitoring the gradual reduction of water produced by water sources at Buyog deepwell and spring and Pinsao-2 deepwell. As of this date, the yield reduction of the two water sources has affected the normal water supply of the areas to which these are diverted.Through the interconnection project, BWD targets to sustain the equitable distribution of available water supply in the north-north-eastern side of Baguio City.BWD also activated its contingency measure to augment the water supply at the BWD Sanggalang tank by means of BWD water delivery trucks. During normal operations, the Sanggalang tank fills up an average of four to 6.6 meters water level, but this was temporarily affected due to the yield reduction at the Easter, Tam-awan, and Pinsao deepwells.Meanwhile, BWD advised the public to continue observing water conservation practices as supply is affected by the seasonal decline in water supply experienced during the dry season and will be further affected by the anticipated El Niño phenomenon as earlier announced by the Pagasa.An artificial increase in water demand is currently experienced due to the influx of tourists, returning residents, and transients. Nevertheless, the BWD announced it is exerting its best efforts to minimize these effects and is doing all it can to serve its constituents through water supply improvement and expansion projects.BWD customers are advised to install water storage facilities such as tanks, drums, or other containers with a three-day backup water supply as it implements a rationing system. Further, the installation of a sump tank and boosters to pump water to their elevated water storage facilities is highly encouraged as this comes as part of the standard water system set-up especially at highly elevated residences.Commercial establishments, on the other hand, are advised to apply for additional or enlargement of their current tapping should their daily water demand increase.For concerns and water deliveries, customers are advised to reach the following numbers which can be reached 24/7: 442-3218, 442-4929, 0908-8651-504, 0917-679-4929, 0922-840-9765, or send a message at BWD_Customer Relations Facebook page or send an email to [email protected] – Press release

5,"April 21, holiday to mark Eid’l Fitr",2023-04-16,"President Ferdinand Marcos, Jr. declared April 21 as a regular holiday for the observance of Eid’l Fitr, or the culmination of the Fasting of Ramadan.Marcos signed Proclamation 201 after the National Commission on Muslim Filipinos (NCMF) recommended for the declaration of the date as a national holiday.“In order to bring the religious and cultural significance of the Eid’l Fitr to the fore of national consciousness and to allow the entire Filipino nation to join their Muslim brothers and sisters in peace and harmony in the observance and celebration of Eid’l Fitr, it is necessary to declare April 21, 2023, a regular holiday throughout the country,” the proclamation read.Eid’l Fitr, one of the two most important Islamic celebrations, is observed by the Muslim community three days after the month-long Ramadan fasting.The other important celebration, Eid al-Adha or The Feast of the Sacrifice, is celebrated on the 10th day of the last month of the Islamic calendar and commemorates the willingness of Ibrahim (Abraham) to sacrifice his son to God.Eid al-Adha also marks the end of the Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca, the fifth pillar of Islam.Muslim Filipinos comprise about six percent of the population.To honor country’s Islamic heritage, the government in 2002 established Eid’l Fitr as a regular holiday by virtue of Republic Act 9177 and Presidential Proclamation 1083.The holiday is determined by the use of the lunar-based Islamic calendar through the sighting of the crescent moon in the Islamic month of Shawwal. – PNA

9,More attractions to be set up at Botanical-Centennial Park,2023-04-16,"Plans are afoot for incorporating more “added attractions” at the city’s iconic Botanical-Centennial Park including music to enhance the experience of visitors to the popular promenade area.      During the management committee meeting of local officials at City Hall on April 11, Mayor Benjamin Magalong directed City Environment and Parks Management Office head Rhenan Diwas to purchase the needed sound system for the purpose.      The Cepmo manages the upkeep and overall operations of the Botanical Garden, located along Leonard Wood Road.      Diwas informed the mayor that purchase of the sound equipment is already incorporated in his office’s budget and is undergoing the proper governmental procurement process.      Magalong said putting additional attractions at the Botanical-Centennial Park would generate greater revenues for the city’s coffers by enticing more visitors.      Diwas said selected musicians or buskers were temporarily allowed to play at the area and entertain promenaders while the sound system was still being purchased.      The Botanical Garden is home to indigenous plants and flowers of the Cordillera, and is one of the city’s top tourist draws. – Gaby B.

It was also his first time joining a fishing competition despite practicing fishing for almost three years.Because of the increase of public interest, as well as the city’s plan to further rehabilitate the Baguio Burnham Lake, the future of fishing tournaments in the city looks bright.Serrano plans to have another fishing tournament on June 12 and is hoping to further increase the number of participants. – Aileen Refuerzo and Paula Stephanie Morales

12,CEPMO stops deepwell drilling,2023-04-16,"The City Environment and Parks Management Office issued a stoppage order to a resident drilling a deepwell in one barangay in the city.In a report to Mayor Benjamin Magalong, Engr. Sofronio Pascua of the Cepmo said the owner was advised to secure a permit before proceeding with the drilling.Pascua said they will continue monitoring the site and others of similar situations.Asst. Cepmo head Marivic Empizo said illegal deepwell drilling is punishable under the Environment Code with a maximum fine of P5,000 after court procedure.She said there is an ongoing inventory of deepwells in the city by a committee headed by the Department of the Environment and Natural Resources and Water Utilization Section under the National Water Resources Board (NWRB), and the Cepmo.“If there are drillings reported, these are ordered to stop then monitored by barangay officials to get water drilling permits,” Empizo said.The city government and the Baguio Water District had requested the NWRB to address the proliferation of illegal deepwells in the city being one of the causes of the declining yield of water as these deplete the recharge of underground sources resulting to the decline in pumping water levels.In 2021, the city listed a total of 210 permitted water companies drawing from the city’s aquifers while the number of those that do not have permit was still not determined. – Aileen P.
